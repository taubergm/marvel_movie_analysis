Mom?: KID
##### 
MOM!!!: KID GEN. T. ROSS at his desk. Lost in thought. Snaps out of it when his female aide, MAJOR CABOT, puts some forms on his desk. She moves him through signing boring requisition orders... CABOT ...and here’s something a little more interesting. He holds out his hand, not that optimistic... she hands him a two page fax.. CABOT  Possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee. Woman drank one of these guarana sodas. Had more kick than she was looking for. ROSS Last three were irradiated fruit, not Gamma... CABOT Look at the spectrograph in that path report. Even the FDA didn’t approve that. Whatever it was it was concentrated. Got less than a tenth of a milliliter and it almost killed her.
##### ROSS Get it confirmed. CABOT Already put calls in. She starts out but he stops her, mind alive now. ROSS Where was it bottled? CABOT Porto Verde, Brazil... Both look at each other... searching for the same thing.
ROSS: Remember that package we tracked to the girl that just had a pressed orchid in it? Year and half ago maybe...? CABOT It came from Sao Paolo. Ross comes alive. ROSS Get our Agency people looking for a white man at that bottling plant. Tell them no contact, if he even sees them he’s gone. And get me Sam Greller! A TRANSPORT VAN pulling up, TWO ARMY SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS hop out with their light gear and move to join... THREE OTHER COMMANDOS gathered by the edge of the tarmac. They all greet each other, one or two introductions, a few know each other. COMMANDO 1 COMMANDO 2 COMMANDO 1 Who’s our 6? Blonsky. Thought he was on vacation? COMMANDO 2 He got bored. Volunteered. BLONSKY sits by the open door. Over his shoulder we look down at the BASE below rising to meet us. Blonsky is out of the bird and moving with his gear before it’s even fully come to rest. He moves to join the others.
##### ROSS stands aside with his old friend GEN. SAM GRELLER.
ROSS: ...I know you cashed some chips for this, Sam. I’m grateful. GRELLER Glad to do it. Just make it good. They shake hands and Ross heads for a waiting... C-130 TRANSPORT PLANE Ross, Cabot a Medical Officer and the Team muster into the plane as the engines wind up. No delay. The plane lumbers down the runway and roars aloft. Gen. Ross on the phone up front clearing up details. CABOT with him. Soldiers in the rear waiting on intel. COMMANDO 1 Since when do they fob us off to Logistics officers? COMMANDO 2 Ain’t exactly feeling A-Team is it? CABOT comes back to brief the team. Hands out PHOTOS OF BANNER and BANNER’S APT BUILDING and SURROUNDING AREA. CABOT This is the target and the location. Insert and grab only, live capture. You’ll have tranq rifles and suppression ordnance. Live fire for backup only. We’ve got help from local but we want it tight and quiet. One of the soldiers needles gently... COMMANDO 1 Little excitement, huh Major? CABOT How’s that? COMMANDO 1 Got tired of pushing paper around? She’s way ahead of him.
##### 
CABOT: I worked intel for 3rd I.D. on the way in to Baghdad my first tour. I got bumped to you Rangers in time for Falluja. Says here me and Blonsky got our Purple Hearts same week. So, no, I’d very much like to get back to my office, thanks. To all of them... CABOT Only way this’ll get exciting is if you guys screw it up. Any more questions? No more stupid ones. ROSS appears behind them. BLONSKY Is he a fighter? ROSS Your target is a fugitive from the US government and stole military secrets. He is implicated in the deaths of three scientists, a military officer, an Idaho State trooper and possibly two Canadian hunters. Don’t wait to see if he’s a fighter. Put him to sleep. Blonsky nods. A good mission. ROSS Each two man team will be issued a radiation sensor which we will monitor remotely as well. First blip I want to know about it. COMMANDO 2 This guy steal plutonium? ROSS Something like that. That’s all. He and Cabot return to the front. Team gossips about Ross a little, his dead arm. COMMANDO 1 Vietnam? Blonsky shrugs, studying Banner. COMMANDO 3 I heard he ran R&D, real black box shit. One of his experiments blew up in his face, literally. They gave him a desk to run.
##### CABOT Blonsky’s your point man. BANNER carting around supplies to the workers at the different points on the bottling line. As he comes around a piece of machinery he sees... THE NICE YOUNG WOMAN being hassled by the FOUR YOUNG TOUGHS.
TOUGH LEADER: Why do you act so shy? It’s not a sin to have some fun in life...
##### He hesitates, torn. He really can’t get involved, can’t risk... But then the TOUGH LEADER tries to STROKE HER CHEEK and she SHOVES HIS HAND AWAY... AND HE GRABS HER ARM. TOUGH LEADER (CONT’D) What are you, too good for us? He shoves Banner in the chest, hard. OTHER TOUGHS moving to the sides. The YOUNG WOMAN SCREAMS AT THEM...
BANNER: Okay listen... don’t make hungry... you wouldn’t like me when I’m... Confusion on their faces -- “that’s a weird thing to say” BANNER ...no wait...that’s not right... ah shit. And the TOUGH takes SWING at him. But BANNER DODGES IT DEFTLY. He doesn’t hit the guy, he hardly seems to touch him but the guy goes flying past and stumbles. TOUGH LEADER gets up and wipes his hands, pissed now. AND HE PUTS UP HIS FISTS AND COMES AT BANNER PUNCHING Banner dodges, ducks, weaves and applies his non-aggressive martial arts techniques, hardly touching the guy but leaving him flailing like a total fool... The MANAGER, from the catwalk above...sees what’s going on MANAGER HEY!! Cut it out! I got supply sitting here collecting bugs! You want me to hire somebody else to move it! NOW!! The TOUGHS shoot looks at Banner “..another time...” And they walk away, one of them laughing a little and patting LEADER on the shoulder. THE YOUNG WOMAN, sighs and thanks Banner, grateful. Banner lying on his rough bed, THE DOG at his feet. He stares at the ceiling lost in thought when he hears... HIS COMPUTER CHIMES.
##### BANNER sits STUNNED, mind racing. Banner closes the computer and stares at the picture of THE WOMAN (BETTY)... a step closer maybe. He packs up his core equipment into the knapsack as always. Then he remembers the note on the pad. He tears it off and wads it up... nowhere to throw it and so, distracted, he PUTS THE NOTE INTO HIS POCKET. - BETTY and BRUCE sitting on a CAMPUS LAWN in late afternoon light with pizza; she gives him a bite and kisses him -GEN ROSS looking right at us, hand on our shoulder consoling; lips move but no sound comes out; intense He sighs and breathes deeply. He can’t clear his mind tonight. He gives up and gets up. He stands on the roof, sipping a beer. His isolation intense. THE DOG. Asleep at Banner’s feet on the rough bed. Banner on his side breathing deeply. A VERY DARK ALLEY ...almost black and then suddenly snapping into
Clear.: VOICE Two of the SHADOWS along the wall detach themselves and move in a crouch toward the back door; DART RIFLES held at ready, MP5 SUB- MACHINE GUNS slung, balaclavas covering faces. Commandos. Same sounds of the night. And then the muffled barking stops. No yelp or anything obvious. It just stops.
##### A DOG on the landing of the stairwell, darted with a nasty looking little tranquilizer, twitching. BLACK BOOTS move past it, climbing. He signals and one drops low and pulls a snake camera out, feeds it silently under the door. The two others move to apply small plastique packs to the hinges. The soldier with the camera holds up a hand...be ready... Camera Soldier holds up one finger, points right, signals “low, lying down”
Geiger?: ROSS
##### Maj. Cabot's monitor of all three team Geigers shows the same. She shakes 'Negative'. Pillows, the Styrofoam head with the cap and the wig on it. BLONSKY Target’s on the move. She sees him hanging there and SCREAMS.
BLONSKY: He’s on the ground, going rear.
##### Banner sprints for the stairs, no time to even thank her. He's down the stairs and hits.... ... the street, hustling at a carefully controlled walk. ...and we're parallel along with him and as he passes the ALLEY along the side of the building he (and we) catch a moving glimpse of the tail lights of the BLACK VAN and a BLACK CLAD COMMANDO... ...and the COMMANDO sees him ... and IT'S ON. Streets, alleys and rooftops of the SLUM at night. Late night crowds of drinkers and people in the streets. BLONSKY and his partner making the correct guesses about which way to turn in the alleys, hot on Banner’s tail... ROOFTOPS OF THE FAVELA... dropping away in tin terraces below and beyond. A Maze for a rat-race... BANNER’S FEET POUNDING ON TIN ROOFS.
CABOT: Leader we’re at your two-o’clock, team coming from your nine. Got him boxed. Three more moves. Game over.
##### CABOT (CONT’D) Okay...Past mobile unit now oh-nine-zero. Plenty of people drinking. Perfect. toward the kitchen.
and heading: hard. Too freaked by Ross. Pushing through to the back
##### No chit-chat...the guy curses and TAKES A WILD SWING. THE BRAZILIANS SCRAMBLE AFTER HIM. BLONSKY Target acquired. Weaving through the innards of the machinery...almost to the far side now. An Exit sign glowing dim green in the dark... he moves to it. Pushes gently on the latch and opens it to slide out into... BANNER Please...don’t do this.
TOUGH LEADER: What? I can’t understand you. No fight? Not so tough now, huh? Try those fancy moves again. Come on, we all want to see. A HARD PUSH and Banner hits his back into a knob and he CRIES OUT in pain.
##### 
BANNER: Stop. Please stop. Me. Angry. Very bad. TOUGH LEADER You bad angry, son? I VERY BAD ANGRY!
##### 
BANNER: Let me go! You don’t understand. Something really bad is going happen here!! TOUGH LEADER Yeah, something bad is going to happen.
##### BANNER LUNGES, pulling the men holding him TOUGH GUY SLAMS A FIST IN BANNER'S GUT BLONSKY FIRES sighting on his neck. ONE GUY HOLDING BANNER TAKES A DART IN CONFUSED
THE: NECK AND SPINS, 180...200... of figures, one
##### A GREEN PULSE OF LIGHT CUTS ACROSS THE NIGHT VISION BRAZILIAN TOUGHS, turning, all stepping away from Banner crumpled invisible down in the dark out into floor to investigate, two looking at their friend on the ground starting to freak. TOUGH GUY What the hell...? COMMANDOS in the dark trying to get a fix on what's happening they hear... Cabot on the com in their ears...
CABOT: Is target neutral? Did we get a shot?
##### ...something is happening to that one...dim and obscure behind the other figures etched in green... THE SHAPE OF THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND IS CHANGING
SHUT UP!!!: TOUGH LEADER He throws a kick into the shadows... and it's the worst mistake of his life. His foot meets something hard and faster than you can blink he is GONE. RIPPED UPWARD by the leg and into the shadow... His terrified scream drowned by... A ROAR OF RAGE unlike anything. PRIMAL. Not human.
##### ...HE FLIES OUT OF THE DARK, from a height of 14 feet and rising as he goes... thrown literally across the factory like a child's ball, clipping through shafts of light and hitting the far wall head first so hard that you hope he didn't survive. The ROAR fading... A STRANGE BEAT OF SILENCE, as each face tries to grasp the IMPOSSIBLE. squeezed out of it like a bug. Dropped like a rag-doll. THE SHAPE starts to move... CABOT Where’s the target? Chattered responses on the com.
ROSS: That is the target, goddam it, now take it out!! And then CRASHING METAL. Something isn't moving between the machinery, it's smashing through it. We can see the tops of huge arrays, shaking in the light. Sounds of metal wrenching and huge percussive smashes. And somewhere in all the chaos a button gets hit and all the belts and bottles start to move. Adding to the confusion and sound. ROSS Don’t let him out of the building! Put all your tranqs in him! Every one you’ve got! Do it now!!
##### A Shadow moving among the metal and Team 2 opens up. THWWP. THWWP. THWWP. Darts zipping into the dark. A PATCH OF LIGHT on the concrete floor and the darts fall into it. Bent at right angles like they've hit a concrete wall. THE SHADOW SPINS AND COMES AT THEM.
COMMANDO 1: Holy SHIT! GO LIVE! GO LIV--
##### SOUND OF THAT ROARING RAGE and SOLDIERS SCREAMING. THE SHADOW MOVES AGAIN. If the Roars were loud before they now become truly horrifying... THE THING in the DARK turns and moves from left to right, the Soldiers' pan their fire concentrating it on the shadow, most of it clanking into machinery sparks flying, but... IN THE STROBE EFFECT OF THE MUZZLE FLASHES, BEHIND THE FOREST OF METAL...WE SEE THE FORM OF THE THING... MOVING, POWERFUL., SURREAL. THE HEAD HIDDEN IN SHADOW OVER A GIANT, HULKING FORM. As the SHADOW moves across Team 1's fire toward Team 3, BLONSKY BREAKS AND RUNS RIGHT. As always, one step ahead, moving for position. He sees... A LADDER UP TO A CATWALK RUNNING THE PERIMETER OF THE FACTORY. He goes for it. SOUND OF BULLETS CLANKING INTO METAL mixed with SOUND OF BULLETS HITTING FLESH... a flat, thick sound. THE SHADOW TURNS AROUND DIRECTLY INTO THE STREAM OF FIRE ... and then a ROAR and a SICKENING RENDING OF STEEL and AN ENTIRE TOWER of the CONVEYOR BELT is being torn from its base... THE BELT SWUNG at the SOLDIERS LIKE A CLUB. BLONSKY'S PARTNER DIVES, but it tumbles onto his leg, BREAKING THE BONE. HE SCREAMS.
Sir, no!!: CABOT THE SHAPE IS MOVING AGAIN NOW... Faster, it's tormentors silenced... it heads for the back corner, moving under the catwalk where....
##### THE CAMERA SLIDES TO THE RIGHT...PAST THE BACK OF THE ENORMOUS HEAD...and as it passes the head, emerging over the right shoulder... THE HAND OF THE THING RISES IN FRONT OF US, BLOCKING THE STREAM OF STREAKING BULLETS, AS THOUGH SWATTING AT BEES. AND THEN WITH A SNARL THE ENORMOUS SHOULDER FLEXES AND THE ARM COMES UP......AND A FORKLIFT IS COMING THROUGH THE AIR LIKE A BASEBALL AT BLONSKY. HE DIVES... IT CRUSHES THE CATWALK WHERE HE WAS JUST STANDING... COLLAPSING IT PARTLY AND LEAVING HIM LITERALLY HANGING ON FOR LIFE ABOVE THE FACTORY FLOOR, spinning.... But still able to watch as.... THE HULK bends down into shadow...and with a mighty heave, RIPS A HUGE MACHINE BLOCK OUT OF THE FACTORY FLOOR AND INTO THE AIR... RUNNING IT FORWARD STRAIGHT THROUGH THE FACTORY WALL WITH A TREMENDOUS CRASH. OVER ROSS' SHOULDER, RUNNING TOWARD THE LOOMING WALLS OF THE FACTORY until... THE ENTIRE WALL OF THE FACTORY EXPLODES, THROWING HIM AGAINST A WALL FOR COVER... HE LOOKS JUST IN TIME TO SEE... ...BEHIND ALL THE METAL, MOVING AWAY DOWN THE ALLEY, OBSCURED.. HE SEES THE PHANTOM HE'S BEEN CHASING. IT LOOKS AROUND FOR A MOMENT, EYES GLINT IN THE DARK... ...AND THEN IT'S GONE. ROSS is looking around for clues in Banner’s existence. CABOT is finishing a conversation with the BRAZILIAN OFFICER.
CABOT: The stuff in the bottles was basic lab chemicals. Zero intel. Like he knew we were coming and cleaned the place. Not a scrap of paper. As if on cue, BLONSKY enters... with BANNER’s BACKPACK. He thunks it up on the table... BLONSKY Saw he had it on the run, but it was gone right before I got the shot off... found it under the machine that our guys got hit with. CABOT is already in it. Antenna...COMPUTER. Jackpot. And the PICTURE OF BETTY. Blonsky examines it. BLONSKY  Girlfriend? Maybe she helps him...
##### Cabot shoots a look at Ross. Hard, expressionless.
ROSS: No, we closed that door to him a long time ago. Ross takes the photo from Blonsky and stares at it for a long beat. Thoughts unreadable. BLONSKY Sir, with all respect...Does somebody want to tell me just what the hell went down in there? What was that thing? Ross looks away out the window at the light coming up on the slum. CABOT There’s rumors in the street about sightings...farmer says he saw a gorilla going into the edge of the forest. BLONSKY That was no gorilla. It was 10 feet tall and green...or gray. I couldn’t tell. But it wasn’t an animal and you can’t tell me that thing is hiding somewhere. ROSS Two thousand miles of jungle to hide in. He’s gone. BLONSKY What about Banner? CABOT Local PD’s on alert. He must have got out when that Thing attacked us... ROSS That was Banner. CABOT You think he led us into it? ROSS No I mean It...was Banner. It wasn’t an animal, it was him. BLONSKY You’re going to have to explain that statement. ROSS No, I’m not. You did your jobs well, both of you. We were undermanned and that’s my fault. 
##### 
ROSS: I didn’t think it would happen again... Pack up and get our men on the plane. We’re going home. He walks out leaving Cabot and Blonsky dumbstruck. Banner wakes up in the woods. It's looks like the South American forest. Banner makes his way up out of A LOGGING TRUCK is coming down in the window BANNER Can you help me? TRUCKER No habla Portuguese. the trees to a rough mountain road. the road. He waves it down. Leans BANNER Where..? Donde...donde estoy? TRUCKER Paroma. Paraguay? Brazil es ayi... Ochenta kilometers. He waves Banner inside. Banner sits against a wall begging for money. Banner buys clothes at a stall in the market. Finds stretchy pants finally. Better yet, finds a pair of Lycra shorts that look like they'd almost be too big for him. Discreetly holds the leg of the Lycra shorts up behind a very fat lady and stretches one leg hole wide - not as big as her back. BANNER Mas grande.
##### A muddy alley full of raw trash. Banner is pulling on his new clothes. Finishing he starts to ball up his shredded pants to toss them in a pile when a piece of paper floats down out of one of the torn pockets. He throws the pants down and picks the paper up and looks at it...
CABOT: He’s tight, this one. No names, all authors names deleted. He was using a randomizer to tap different wireless networks every time he went online. We can’t even trace where his email went or where it came from. Ross absorbed in the pages, a new urgency breaking over him. ROSS He’s trying to get rid of it. CABOT We’ll have the Agency people down here keep their radar up. ROSS It doesn’t matter. He’s already on the move. Banner riding with migrant workers.
##### Banner hiking through rugged terrain to avoid border crossings Banner trying to sleep in the doorway of a locked store in a Latin city somewhere. Car lights spill across him huddled there. Eyes closed, but moving under the lids... LIGHTS ACCELERATING AT US, horribly overcharged sound of a TRUCK HORN and a TREMENDOUS CRASH. Jump cutting -- The impossible image of the CAB OF A TRACTOR TRAILER being twisted over by our own massive hands... the HUGE LOAD OF LOGS ON ITS BED SPILLING OUT BEYOND. All horribly distorted and streaked. Like an acid trip. Night crossing the desert border with illegals (Mexico to US). A family has children with them, having trouble. Banner picks one up and helps the child across the river. Banner jumps a FREIGHT TRAIN. In the U.S. now...heading somewhere. Greller sits at his desk looking up at Ross, incredulous.
GRELLER: You wanna tell me that one more time? ROSS Do I look like I’m not being serious, Sam? GRELLER T., I’ve known you a long time and I’ve never seen a cooler head under fire. 
##### 
GRELLER: I know something bit you in the ass down there, but that is one hell of a White Whale story. And I am way out on a limb with you on this already. ROSS Ask Blonsky. BLONSKY sits in dress uniform, waiting. DOOR OPENS from the inner office. ROSS stands there...nods. BLONSKY ...yes, sir. I’d say ten or eleven feet. I’d put him at 1500 pounds easily but could be more. And green. Or gray. Greenish gray. It was very dark. I put three clips on it, sir and didn’t even flinch. I didn’t miss, I’ll stake my medals on that. GRELLER Captain, is there a medal you haven’t won? BLONSKY Medal of Honor, sir. A high percentage are given posthumously of course. Greller rubs his forehead, Blonsky still sharp at attention. GRELLER Relax, will you Blonsky? T., you wanna tell me what the hell you think is really going on here? ROSS Banner’s work was a tangent of Bio-Tech. GRELLER You told me you were going to Brazil to nab a scientist. Are you telling me one of your Super Soldier experiments got out of the box? ROSS I’m telling you that this could be an incredibly dangerous weapon in the wrong hands and we have no idea what his intentions are.
##### 
GRELLER: Put together a new list. Ross and Blonsky walk out of the meeting with Greller. BLONSKY Are you telling me he becomes that thing at will? I don’t have Greller said if I ask... ROSS an answer to that, soldier. BLONSKY “Super Soldier”. Do you mind ROSS Yes, I mind. You’re asking questions way above your paygrade, Captain. BLONSKY Respectfully sir, I lost two men back there who had made it through some bad shit with me. One was on his way out to have a family. I’d just like to know what we got mixed up in. ROSS You hungry? A classic silver-car diner near the base. Through the plate glass windows in a corner booth we see Ross and Blonsky over a table. ROSS ...do appreciate your professionalism but let me emphasize that what I’m about to share with you is tremendously sensitive to both me personally and the Army. Blonsky nods, all ears ROSS I’m sure you’re aware that we’ve got an Infantry Weapons Development program...within it however we ran a subprogram for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.
##### 
ROSS: It was very promising but none of it panned out. Or, it did but it was...unstable. Made the subjects unstable. I wanted to refine it.. but then Al-Haquid happened and Congress killed it. No stomach. BLONSKY You’ll need something special to go against that thing. Someone who can survive to learn how to fight it. I’d be willing. ROSS Blonsky, how old are you? 40? BLONSKY ROSS Why are you still a Captain? You should be a full Colonel with your record. Shit you could be a Senator! Take your pick. Get out of the trench. BLONSKY I don’t want to lead. I’m a fighter. That’s all I want to be and I want to be the best for as long as I can and I don’t want to lose a step and if there’s something I can take to give me an edge, I want it. ROSS Well, I’m glad to see that all that advertising we do actually works. You know when I came back from Vietnam I was 27. I looked 45. So you’re beating the curve. But it takes a toll doesn’t it? BLONSKY Yes it does. They clink glasses. Mutual respect growing. A team forming. Ross admits himself and one medical technician into a secured medical storage room. It takes codes to get through doors. Individual codes to open any of the cold storage lockers. Ross opens one...the fog of liquid nitrogen keeping something preserved. Ross nods and the technician lifts out the metal canisters...
##### After hours and off the books. Ross supervises as Blonsky gets his first injection of the Super Soldier serum. TWO MEDICAL TECHS make the preparations.
MEDICAL TECH: You’ll get two separate infusions, dripped in very slowly. One into the deep muscle, one into bone marrow centers. The bone ones are going to hurt. ROSS We’re giving you a very low dose only. I need you sharp out there, disciplined. First side of any side effect and we stop and you’re off team until you straighten out. Agreed? Blonsky nods again. He’s committed. A sprawling semi-rural Southeastern campus.
##### He scopes out the surroundings, not overly intense but careful. He walks to a BIG STONE BUILDING. He looks up... MAYNARD HALL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES (the note in his pocket) He watches as students and faculty flow in and out. He mounts the steps and peers through the doors He walks away, head down, thinking...passing ANOTHER BUILDING.. He stops. Looks at it. BIOLOGY. He hangs a moment, deciding then goes in the doors. BANNER scans the directory/faculty board. Searching for something... and there it is... “CELLULAR BIOLOGY - DR. ELIZABETH ROSS” He slips back out the door. TWO WOMEN talking together as they exit, and one of them is BETTY ROSS. Dark, lovely. And then he follows-- - she gets coffee with the friend and sits and talks - says goodbye and checks her blackberry and smiles and types back She is walking now...He could go to her...and then... ...he sees the guy walking toward her smile. And she smiles back and accepts his embrace and kiss. This is SAMSON. They link arms and walk together and Banner has to watch them walk away, Betty's hand slipping inside Samson's. Another life. He turns away and puts himself back on course. The owner, STAN, early 60’s, is turning the sign on the door to CLOSED when a figure slides up and knocks on the glass. STAN freezes as he sees the face of... BANNER. Stan looks like he’s seen a ghost. Bruce and the owner catch up. Clearly, they were friends from Bruce's old life.
STAN: ...so many rumors. People say the worst things without any idea what they’re saying. BANNER Stan, I promise you, whatever you’ve heard about me isn’t true. Stan pats his leg...
##### 
STAN: I know it. I know people and I always knew it. But you know how I felt about you two... Have you talked to...? BANNER No. She’s with.... STAN Samson. Yeah, you heard. He’s a head shrink. They say one of the best. But a good guy. Take my word. Reminds me of you a lit-- Sorry. Bruce, what can I do to help you? BANNER I could use a place to stay a few nights. STAN You’ll stay in the spare room upstairs. Use the back, nobody’ll see you come or go. BANNER Great. One other thing...can I deliver a few pizzas? STAN Deliver all you want, I’ll give Lou the week off. But someday you gotta tell me what all this was about. BANNER Stan, if I told you, you’d never believe me. BANNER ON A BICYCLE, delivering pizzas. He’s even got the Stanley’s hat. Shades too now, keeping a very low profile. Banner delivers a pie to a room full of kids studying and arguing about issues. That used to be him. A HOT, BITCHY SORORITY CHICK opens the door, others beyond her. She’s laughing, takes the two pies and bag of extras and sodas without even acknowledging him... She goes to close the door--
##### 
Thanks...: CHICK BANNER Ummm...sorry. That’s $46.50 CHICK Oh...we have an account with Stanley. He knows us... We’re Theta. BANNER I can see that you are. Do you mind if we call him? CHICK Yes, I mind...anyway it took forever and now it’s cold. As she says this she pulls out a black olive and on ‘cold’ she FLICKS IT OFF HER FINGER... And it lands on Banner’s hat... Oops. Sorry. CHICK BANNER You know, you shouldn’t make me angry. You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry CHICK Whatever, pscycho. She slams the door on him. Peals of laughter from inside. He turns to go off the porch and a fat KEG DELIVERY KID is coming up the steps... he saw it all. KEG GUY Dude, where are your balls? You can’t lay down for that shit! You gotta smash that door in and... Banner enters with two pizzas. Guard looks up. BANNER I got a delivery on 5. GUARD I don’t think anybody’s up there. BANNER Oh man, everybody’s bailing... I already got an medium with no takers. You want it?
##### 
GUARD: Don’t let me stand in the way of commerce. God bless, brother. Takes the pizza happily and waves him through. Banner comes down the hall toward his former lab, the place HULK was born... The LAB is a large open space seen through half-glassed walls. Long work tables full of computer terminals. Large Super-Computer arrays along the walls. It has been turned into a Computer Science lab in the intervening years. One lone computer nerd GRAD STUDENT, burning the midnight oil at a terminal..brain fried, eyes bleary. Banner stares at the familiar layout and just as the GRAD STUDENT looks up and meets his eye...
##### Images from the accident that created the HULK. Surreal and overamped as before but more detailed this time.
- FIRE: - a huge MRI-like machine  rising above us and being smashed through glass -bodies of two of Banner’s grad students lying still under the control console driven back onto them, a soldier in uniform also still - BETTY, still on the ground a gash in her head - ROSS on the floor, backing up holding his left arm in agony, trying to reach Betty and looking up at... BANNER POPS OUT OF IT. The guy is looking at him... or at his pizza. Banner opens the door. BANNER Those douches in radiation called this in and then split. You want it? COMPUTER NERD Whoever you are, you are my new personal hero. BANNER Hey...you mind if I jump online for a second?
##### COMPUTER NERD Totally. You wanna join my Vice City...”Manolo, choot this piece of chit.” BANNER Righteous. Gimme a sec. He sits down and gets to work accessing the University’s mainframe. Bingo. Every attempt to find the records of his program yields no evidence that it ever existed. They have totally expunged all record of his work. HE SAGS. RING. He looks up. He is receiving a chat invite from “StealthWarrior229”. He looks at it for a long time. The ringing continues. It’s impossible they have found him here. Almost impulsively he clicks “Accept”... the VIDEO CHAT WINDOW OPENS TO REVEAL... A DIGITAL ANIMATION OF A HUGE MONSTROUS CREATURE, like something out of DOOM, SMASHING WALLS, RAGING until it finds... A PIZZA. AND EATS IT. AND THE MONSTER STARTS TO SHRINK, GROWLING CONTENTEDLY AND THE IMAGE RESOLVES INTO... THE GRAD STUDENT.
BANNER: ...gone. All of it. Like it never happened.
##### 
STAN: The whole building was closed for a year after the explosion. Military guards... BANNER I don’t know what I was thinking. There’s nothing for me here. I don’t know why I came...I hoped... STAN What’ll you do now? BANNER I’ll go in the morning. Where? STAN BANNER It’s better if I don’t tell you, Stan. STAN I’m so sorry. I wish I could... BANNER You did help me, Stan. You’ve got no idea how nice it is just to see a friendly face. THE BELL ON THE DOOR TINGS, a customer entering... STAN I’ll just get rid of em and we’ll have some food... Stan comes out of the back hearing laughter and looks up and stops cold... IT’S BETTY AND SAMSON, grabbing a slice on the way home. He tries to hurry em along... STAN Kids! I got nothing but marinara now... BETTY Oh, I need a Mr. Pink, Stan. Please! SAMSON She worked through dinner again. Betty and Samson talk as Stan starts to make up the special slices... his eyes keep darting to the back...
##### 
BETTY: Not too spicy, Stan... STAN I know how you like it... Her focus comes back up to Stan and behind him, in the back, A MOVEMENT CATCHES HER EYE.
##### STAN MOVES AND BLOCKS HER VIEW...THEN MOVES AWAY AGAIN AND BANNER IS GONE. SAMSON’S MOUTH is moving but everything is SILENT. She stares at the space where she just saw a ghost. But it wasn’t a ghost...it was BRUCE. AND SHE RUNS. Dashing under the counter and through the back after him... Samson agape...
BRUCE!: BETTY He stops but doesn’t turn and she moves toward him, still not able to believe it’s actually him...and as she draws near. HE TURNS AND FACES HER and she stops in her tracks, her hand flying to her mouth...she could literally faint from the level of adrenaline and emotion shooting through her body. BRUCE It’s alright... SAMSON bursts out the door... Betty!? SAMSON
##### He sees her standing with a dark figure, her hand starting to reach trembling toward him.
BETTY: When did...? Are you...? BRUCE I’m alright. I’m so sorry, I didn’t want to... Samson comes up behind her and Banner looks up. SAMSON Betty, what happened? Are you okay? BETTY Samson, this is....this is Bruce... Bruce Banner. He takes Banner in for a beat and then reaches out his hand.. SAMSON Samson Adams. And he and Banner shake. The rain is starting to fall more steadily... BETTY Can you...? There are just so many things... I can’t... SAMSON We should get in out of the rain. We’re just on our way home now. Will you join us? BANNER Yes...thanks, I’d like that. I need to...uh... Tell me where and I’ll meet you there in a few minutes. SAMSON 39 Hillhouse. On the corner of Maple...by the old... BANNER Yes I remember. Alright. Samson nods and turns with Betty to go back through Stanley’s.
##### Banner explodes into the room, and starts throwing his few clothes into a very small nylon bag. He stops over the sink, looking at himself in the mirror... Raining hard now. Samson and Betty pull up through their driveway and into the garage. BETTY SAMSON I need to go find him... I think you should... Samson looks at her, understanding...nods. SAMSON I’ll be here. BETTY drives through the streets looking for him, desperate. The RAIN is hard now, a thundershower. She pulls up to the bigger road leading out away to the highway, looks right into the dark...nothing. Looks left and we see the reaction on her face at something she sees... WIDE looking at the shoulder of the road, RAIN pouring down... and BANNER’s lonely figure, small in the dark walking along. HEADLIGHTS approach him from behind and he turns and holds out his thumb and we pan left as the car pulls up ahead of him on the shoulder, brake lights casting a red glow... AND THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN AND BETTY IS OUT AND RUNNING TOWARD HIM. AND SHE EMBRACES HIM LIKE SOMEONE BACK FROM THE DEAD...AND HE HUGS HER BACK, FINALLY.
BETTY: Please don’t go away. Please. I need to see you and talk to you. BRUCE I want to...so much. But it’s not safe. BETTY I don’t care. Please. You can’t just disappear again. I couldn’t take it.
##### 
BRUCE: I don’t want to make things more difficult for you. I couldn’t bear that. BETTY I want you to come with me now. He does too.
##### Betty hits the clicker and the garage door descends behind her. And then BANNER SITS UP IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. Samson steps into the living room as Betty emerges from the mudroom/garage entrance. He looks at her...wondering. Betty holds out her hand... AND BANNER STEPS INTO THEIR HOME.
SAMSON: Welcome. Now both of you go get out of those wet clothes. I think we all need some hot food and a number of drinks. You’re talking, I’m cooking. Now go... Samson cooking food while Bruce and Betty talk across a small dining table off the living room. We hear some of what they’re saying in fragments from Samson’s side of it.
##### 
BETTY: ...and they just let you stay? BRUCE I think it was novel at first, they don’t get the spiritual tourism up there on the Northern Plateau. And I’m good at fixing things so... It was peaceful. For a long time that’s all I wanted. 
##### 
BRUCE: When I heard the rug dealer down in town had gotten internet...my brain started going and eventually I couldn’t resist. That’s how I got to Sterns. BETTY And trimethodine... BRUCE I didn’t think you could synthesize an inhibitor that complex but he has been. I mean five years ago... BETTY We’re all a lot further along than we were then, but Sterns is way out in front on that score. He had some kind of ethics cloud around him at Cal Tech but it didn’t stop him. His work is unbelievably brilliant. So, Brazil for the corablanca? BRUCE He’s synthesizing it but I had to try to get it at the source. It took a long time just to get there. And I couldn’t get a thousandth of what I’d need. If he’s even right... And now? BETTY BRUCE I go find him, I suppose. I don’t know if he’s really got something and it’s a much longer shot without the data but I’ve got to risk it... BETTY No, you don’t. She gets up and goes to a bookshelf with a vase on it. She shakes out a small DATA/FLASHCARD on ring, with a lanyard. She goes back and hands it to him. BETTY I got in there before they carted it all away. I hoped it would tell us something someday. BRUCE Does the General know you have this? BETTY I don’t think so.
##### 
BRUCE: He was there in Brazil. When they came for me. I saw him. BETTY Oh my god...he’s crazier than anybody knows. I’m so sorry... How? BRUCE I’ve twisted it round every possible way. Is there anyway it could have been Sterns? BETTY I hear he’s a total anarchist. Hates authority. Doesn’t think he should answer to anybody. That’s why he got in trouble. Bruce, why didn’t you...?
##### I think we’re all set. Bruce/Betty/Samson eat together at a kitchen table. Convivial, determinedly light, staying off the obvious weight of it all for a moment. Samson is telling a funny story.
SAMSON: ...and I said “Miss So-and-so, I’ve been analyzing your ‘condition’ for nearly three months and I think I can say conclusively that your issues are more Caffeinated-UnCaffeinated than Manic- Depressive... They all laugh, even Banner chuckles. BETTY ...You’re not so much Multiple Personality as Spoiled Brat... BANNER Your problem isn’t ADD so much as laziness. BETTY It makes you sound cruel. But Samson takes a few of these to pay for all the free work he does. SAMSON Pro-whiners to pay for the pro-bono... SAMSON
##### Still laughing... but something has happened. Banner has put his hand to his forehead and...he is weeping. Something long-held is being released and he begins to simply cry. Betty and Samson fall silent, bearing witness. Betty takes his hand until he pulls himself together.
BRUCE: I’m so sorry. It’s been a long time since I felt...light...about anything. BETTY It’s alright...you’re with friends. All say good night. Bruce shakes Samson’s hand. BRUCE Good night. SAMSON Sleep well. Samson heads for their bedroom. Betty walks Bruce to the spare room. The moment is bittersweet. BETTY Do you need anything? BRUCE No. I should go early tomorrow. If I can borrow cash from you, I’ll take the bus. BETTY Of course. I’ll drive you out to the station. It’s hard for her to leave him alone, awkward. He looks so tired and lonely. But she finally turns. Betty shuts the door and dissolves, crying hard, silently, stifling it. She enters. He can see that she’s cried and comes to her. She hugs him hard BETTY Thank you.
##### He hears a small thump from the Living Room and turns his head to listen.... Banner emerges into the dark of the living room, cautious. SAMSON is in front of the fireplace adding a log to a small fire he’s got going. He got a pillow and blanket on the couch for himself and a bottle of wine.
BANNER: Hey... Samson jumps badly...he didn’t hear Bruce... SAMSON Good lord, you scared me... He sits on the couch and Banner sits in the chair opposite him. SAMSON I thought it might be easier for all of us...Want some wine? I’m having a lot. They both start to laugh because there's no getting around it all. He drains his glass, fills it and gives it to Bruce and keeps the bottle. They talk in low tones... BANNER You’re been incredibly generous. I’m very sorry to have...dropped in like this. SAMSON I think I read a Raymond Carver story about a situation like this once... 
##### 
SAMSON: I seem to remember thinking there was a lesson in it but it eludes me at the moment. So much for the insights of literature. BANNER Whatever you may think, I didn’t come here to see Betty... SAMSON Then why did you come? BANNER I have a problem...I thought part of the solution might be here. SAMSON Cryptic. But I’ll take it at face value.
##### This is said simply, directly...without threat or malice.
BANNER: There are...aspects of my personality that I can’t control. And I hurt Betty...in ways I will never forgive myself for.
##### 
SAMSON: You don’t drop your career and fall off the face of the earth for five years because you’ve got an anger management issue, Bruce. You see a shrink. BANNER It’s a little more complicated than that. Samson, I’ve been alone for a long time now. I have to be. The toughest part of it is that I worry about what I’ve done to Betty. If she’s happy and you’re a part of that, then that makes me very happy. Honestly. The last thing I want to do is cause any trouble for her...or for you. I’d kill myself before I’d hurt her again. SAMSON Totally honest and yet avoiding something. Exactly like her. Bruce pulling his sweatshirt on, stepping into the hall. He can hear Betty and Samson in the kitchen. Talking in low tones... barely hears.... SAMSON Just promise me you’ll come straight home... Betty steps out into the living room, Samson behind her. Ready? BETTY BANNER Stop a second... She pulls the car over. Banner gets out of the car and steps up onto the grass and across the walking paths to a spot with a tree and bench and a view of the buildings and lawns. Betty moves next to him.
##### 
BANNER: What were we doing here? I mean what were we really trying to accomplish? Do you ever ask yourself that? BETTY We were trying to...understand. Crack a puzzle. Advance things a little. BANNER I think that’s what we told ourselves. At least the General was honest about what he wanted out of it. I don’t think we were as honest. BETTY No, you’ve turned this on yourself too hard. We did talk about it and we were all comfortable. The worst you can say is that you rushed it...but you took your own risks, you didn’t ask anybody else too. BANNER But it wasn’t me that died. BETTY Nobody thought something like that was possible... BANNER I don’t know...Nature took a long time to build us like we are...this whole delicate wonderfully sophisticated system refined over billions of years. We come in and monkey with it...think we can improve it overnight. Sooner or later it’s going to blow up in our face... Thunder rumbles in the distance... a summer storm. As they are talking... he begins to perceive something odd... people clearing away from the open campus... is it about to rain again?
##### A SNIPER MOVES FOR POSITION...THEY'VE COME FOR HIM. His face tenses... He grabs Betty BANNER (CONT’D) They’re here.
What...?: BETTY BANNER Go home. You’ve got to get as far away from me as you can, right now! Go!! And he breaks and runs. He takes off at a full sprint, moving right to left along the buildings, trying to outdistance the soldiers before they get a bead on him... Betty starting to run toward the direction they saw the soldiers. MORE SOLDIERS coming into view, sweeping across the grounds between the buildings heading in the direction Bruce went. In the distance, through the campus complex on the road on the far side she sees FOUR HUMVEES jumping off the road and heading the same way along the opposite perimeter of the campus. One has a MOUNTED .50 Cal gun; two have LARGE STRANGELY SHAPED CANNONS MOUNTED ON THE REAR; One has a FLAMETHROWER on a SWIVEL MOUNT. Betty starts looking around, frantic...
##### Soldiers on foot giving chase... a Humvee far off behind the buildings, accelerating along the grass. Ross, Cabot and technicians, monitoring the progress. Ross is fuming that the trap got blown...Cabot is already adjusting.
ROSS: Goddam it! We’d have had snipers on target in three more minutes. I want to know who waved at that civilian... They’re going to Sadr City!! CABOT Target on the run, heading 350, Sniper 2 has the shot. Straight at your 12 Blonsky.
##### 
Got him.: BLONSKY
##### 
BLONSKY: Shit. We’re made. He’s going inside. Blonsky and his men break from cover and sprint to close in from this side.
##### BLONSKY is MUCH FASTER than the others. IMPOSSIBLY FAST. Kneeling at the bottom of the stairs, ripping off his pack, fumbling to get something out... THE DATA CARD. She heads toward it... He tears up the stairs...
BLONSKY: Look alive, this could get interesting.
##### BETTY I know it’s you! ROSS and CABOT are monitoring screens, radiation counters. CABOT looks out the window to monitor movements on the ground and she spots Betty...
CABOT Sir...sir?: Ross looks up at her... CABOT  It’s your daughter. Ross turns...sees Betty outside... BETTY  Come out of there! Ross throws the door of the vehicle open and jumps out... two soldiers emerge to flank and cover him ... and they stand facing each other. BETTY Please don’t do this... He needs help! ROSS You can’t see this clearly now get inside. He moves to grab her arm and she resists...
##### SOLDIER’S VOICE (OVER RADIO) Target is in the overpass. Have visual. ROSS
CABOT: Hold positions, stand down. ROSS Put canisters in that tube, one on either side. FROM SHELTERING COVER ALONG THE WALLS OF THE BUILDINGS BELOW THE OVERPASS, TWO SOLDIERS WITH SHOULDER FIRED GRENADE LAUNCHERS STEP OUT AND AIM UP AT THE TUBE... AND FIRE GAS CANISTERS UP AT IT.
##### SMASH! The gas canisters BURST through the windows from below on either side of BANNER, CLANK into the ceiling, clatter to the floor and immediately start filling the tube of the overpass with a paralyzing gas. BANNER’s EYES GO WIDE, reflexively he takes a deep breath and holds it.
BRUCE!!: BETTY She breaks from in front of the Command Van and starts running across the wide grass toward the tube... ROSS Get her back here!!
##### BANNER spots Betty running across the grass get TACKLED BY TWO SOLDIERS BANNER'S EYES GO WIDE just as... A GREEN PULSE STROBES THROUGH THE WHITE SMOKE Blonsky, Ross, Betty and Cabot react... RADIATION MONITORS in the VAN SPIKE INTO RED CABOT Geiger’s lighting up! ROSS Alright...now we’ll see. LIGHTS FLICKER over the Soldiers on either side of the door BETTY's FACE, looking up at the tube as... A HAND AND ARM SLAP UP AGAINST THE GLASS, CLAWING IN AGONY... NORMAL EXCEPT FOR ITS GREENISH GRAY COLOR AND THEN THAT ARM STARTS TO SWELL AND RIPPLE, MUSCLES EXPLODING ALONG THE LENGTH OF IT... AND THEN THE ARM DROPS OUT OF SIGHT. THE FIGURE IN THE SMOKE NOW AN ENORMOUS DARK SHAPE ON ITS KNEES... IT BEGINS TO RISE. GLASS SHATTERS ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE TUBE, SMOKE POURING OUT OF IT...REVEALING...
THE HULK.: OUR FIRST FULL VIEW OF HIM... MUSCLES RIPPLING, POURING HIS RAGE OUT ON THE PUNY PEOPLE BELOW... CABOT They should not put this in the recruitment video. AND THEN HULK LEAPS DOWN FROM ABOVE, SMOKE TRAILING OFF HIM AS HE FALLS... POUNDING INTO THE GROUND, MAKING IT TREMBLE. LANDING WITH ONE KNEE BENT... HE RISES UP TO FIGHT.
##### The lawns and fields between the campus buildings and the woods.
ROSS: We’re going to Bravo. Move him 360 in range of the cannons. Keep your cool and be ready to move. Alpha Team give him all of it. Immediately a BARRAGE OF MACHINE GUN FIRE POUNDS INTO THE HULK’s RIGHT...BLASTING FROM THE SCULPTURE GARDEN. Six Soldiers with assault rifles supported by a HUMVEE with a MOUNTED .50 Cal. ROUNDS pepper the Hulk like bees, stinging and enraging him. He throws up an arm to ward them off but then instead of being driven left HE TURNS AND CHARGES INTO THE FIRE THE .50 Caliber STARTS BLASTING These rounds hit HULK harder, with the flat smack of a bullet hitting a tree. THEY HURT. HULK RAISES UP HIS HAND LIKE A SHIELD, THE HEAVY ROUNDS POUNDING AGAINST HIS PALM AND RAKING DOWN HIS LEGS BUT HE COMES CHARGING ON and Soldiers scatter...
##### Hulk raises his fists high and brings them down through the engine block, CRUSHING THE NOSE INTO THE GROUND. HANDS IN THE ENGINE BLOCK, HE HEAVES THE VEHICLE UP, THE GUNNER STILL CLINGING ON FOR LIFE, AND SMASHES IT AGAINST THE MASSIVE BLACK, STEEL PLATES OF A 20 FOOT HIGH CALDER SCULPTURE, OVER AND OVER. THE HUMVEE DISINTEGRATES IN EXPLOSIONS OF METAL AND GAS, SCATTERING REMAINING SOLDIERS ROARING HE SPINS BEHIND THE HUGE SCULPTURE, THE ENGINE BLOCK STILL DANGLING IN HIS HANDS. From profile now we can see that A MOUNTED FLAMETHROWER ON ANOTHER HUMVEE is pouring a stream of flame across the lawn at HULK, the FIRE BLASTING AGAINST THE PLATES OF THE SCULPTURE AND FLOWING AROUND AND PAST HULK. THE JET CUTS OFF AS THE VEHICLE MANEUVERS TO GET AN ANGLE ON HULK AND IN THIS SPLIT SECOND BREAK HULK STEPS OUT , RAISES THE ENGINE BLOCK OVER HIS HEAD AND HURLS IT LIKE SOCCER THROW-IN, PULVERIZING THE VEHICLE AND FLAME GUN WHICH CATCH FIRE, THE DRIVER CRUSHED, THE GUNNER SPILLING OUT IN FLAMES AND ROLLING. THUNDER CRACKS and HULK ROARS HIS DISPLEASURE... ROSS (CONT’D) GODDAM IT!! I need real firepower, where’s our air support?!
CABOT: Base, we need that bird on target without delay... ROSS If you can’t push him get him to chase you but move him toward those cannons, damn it--!
##### Exits his front door and hears the clatter of small arms fire...and he STARTS TO RUN. HULK IGNORES THEM, bullets smacking his back and CLANKING off the steel plates of the big sculpture. HULK likes these plates and he HEAVES AGAINST ONE, tearing it off it’s center mounting bolt like the PULLS AGAINST A SECOND PLATE-- the METAL SCREECHING as it tears away. And then something hard and heavy strikes the back of his head and EXPLODES UNDER HIM, stinging his legs...
He turns....BLONSKY.: Throwing GRENADES like fastballs, perfect strikes. He's got Hulk's attention and that's what Blonsky wants. BLONSKY Remember me? HULK ROARS AND CHASES BLONSKY, wielding his plates like scythes... Blonsky dodges and fights with what increasingly looks like impossible  strength and speed. LEAPING TO AVOID THE SLICING PLATES, SPRINGBOARDING OFF OF THEM, WHILE TURNING AND FIRING HIS WEAPONS INTO THE HULK AT CLOSE RANGE.
##### 
ROSS: Jesus, he’s doing it... EARS ON!!
##### He’s dashing between them.
BLONSKY: Hit him....hit him NOW!!
##### BLONSKY IS GOING TO BE CAUGHT IN THE CROSS FIRE WITH HULK... BUT HE DIVES OVER 20 FEET INTO THE SAFETY ZONE AND ROLLS, COMES UP AND LOOKS BACK AT... The second one comes right on the heels of the first, pounding in from the right, catching him in a crushing crossfire. HIS HANDS FLY TO HIS HEAD. With his over-amped sense this is the worst thing that could happen to him. THE WAVES spill across Hulk and beyond him, expanding and decimating all in their path. TREES vibrate and split; WINDOWS in the faces of the buildings explode and BRICK and MORTAR tremble. THE WAVES ARE NIGHTMARE OF DISTORTION...ALMOST LIKE BEING HAMMERED BY STEEL. THE WORLD A DISTORTED BLUR BEYOND ANYTHING WE’VE YET SEEN.
Nets!: ROSS SOLDIERS in two TWO MAN TEAMS with RPG-like UNITS, run forward into the point of the ‘V’ between the cannons waves and FIRE... NETS...EXPANDING WEBS OF SUPER-STRONG STEEL CABLES DROPPING OVER HULK HULK FALLS FORWARD ONTO ONE FIST, TRYING TO HOLD HIMSELF UP, HIS ARMS STICKING THROUGH THE NETS.
##### BETTY You’re killing him! She starts to run toward him but the same SOLDIERS chase and HOLD HER BACK. Betty - held by two soldiers straining toward the THING. SAMSON
BETTY!!: BRUUCE!! BETTY
##### 
BRUCE!!: BETTY
##### His strength and form visibly swell and he STRAINS upward, raising one of the plates....but the sound waves are too much for him and he DROPS THE PLATE AGAINST THE OTHER ONE With TITANIC EFFORT, his arms sticking through the nets...he heaves up on the steel plates, every muscle straining and bursting with new power, he spreads his arms wide and SMASHES THE PLATES together like giant CYMBALS... THE CRASH is unbelievable and the vibrations push the SONIC WAVES clear of him for a moment and in this moment of freedom... With his right arm HE HURLS ONE PLATE LIKE A MASSIVE THROWING STAR AT THE LEFT-HAND CANNON and THE PLATE CUTS THE HUMVEE AND THE CANNON IN HALF and possibly its operator too. THE SOUND WAVE IS COMING BACK INTO FOCUS from the remaining cannon but now HULK HAS HIS OTHER BIGGER SHIELD UP IN FRONT OF HIS LEFT SHOULDER and the SOUND POURS AGAINST IT AND OVER AND AROUND IT. IN THIS SHELTER he rips the nets off of himself with his right hand. AND LEANS THE SHIELD AGAINST THE SOUND WAVES AND BEGINS TO ADVANCE. BLONSKY AND OTHERS FIRE ON HIM HITTING HIS LEGS but.. LEANING INTO IT LIKE A MAN WALKING INTO A FIREHOSE HULK CLOSES ON THE CANNON, BENDS DOWN, and LEAPS UP AND OUT OF THE CONE OF SOUND, AND COMING DOWN WITH HIS SHIELD DIRECTLY ON THE CANNON, SMASHING IT AND THE WHOLE REAR OF THE HUMVEE AS NEATLY AS A CAR-CRUSHER IN A JUNK YARD. HULK steps off the crushed car, Shield in his left hand. PILOT’S VOICE (OVER RADIO) Two minutes out, Major...
ROSS: All positions, keep him engaged, don’t let him leave and prepare to fall back on my order... Nobody moves. Nobody’s engaging that THING anymore... Except BLONSKY. He gets up and comes at Hulk. UNLOADS HIS FINAL CLIP at Hulk just to get his attention as he circles round to face him. Whips up an M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHER, breaks the short fat tube open and loads a MORTAR ROUND. HULK stands strangely still...watching Blonsky. PILOT’S VOICE Closing...what’s the target? CABOT 290 from my position, 300 yds, ten feet tall and green Come again. PILOT’S VOICE ROSS You heard right. Put everything you’ve got on it. Take it out. Ground teams pull back...
##### 
BLONSKY: Come on, Banner!! That all you got!? ROSS  Blonsky, fall back now!
##### HULK’S EYES NARROW. THIS ONE HE REALLY DOESN’T LIKE. HE LIFTS HIS SHOULDER WITH THE SHIELD AS THOUGH HE MIGHT SWING IT.
BLONSKY: Come on let’s see what else you’ve g-- SMASH!! WITH BLINDING SPEED, HULK SNAPS HIS FOOT OUT AND CATCHES BLONSKY TOTALLY FLATFOOTED THE WHOLE BOTTOM OF HULK’S MASSIVE SOLE MEETS BLONSKY’S BODY SQUARE ON, INSTANTLY BREAKS EVERY BONE IN HIS BODY AND SENDS HIM HURTLING 50 YDS IN THE AIR, LANDING AND SKIDDING FOR 100 YDS MORE THROUGH GRASS, SKIDDING LIKE A LIMP BROKEN DOLL. THE THUNDER CRACKS AND IT BEGINS TO RAIN. HULK TURNS TOWARD ROSS AND BETTY’s POSITION AND STARTS WALKING TOWARD THEM. ROSS Fall back! Bird hitting the deck, fall back! In the distance, maybe the first faint dull THWOP of a rotor. SOLDIERS in Ross’s team scrambling back across the road. Piling out of the command van... ROSS and CABOT hustling too...abandoning the van. Ross’s eyes dart to his soldiers who held Betty...they’re moving across the road...
##### ROSS TURNS TO SEE... BETTY MOVING TOWARD HULK ACROSS THE GRASS AN APACHE GUNSHIP ARCS IN OVER TREES, LOW IN THE DISTANCE and HOVERS INTO POSITION. HULK and BETTY face each other. Betty reaches a hand up to touch his arm...
BETTY: Bruce...? Dim recognition on Hulk’s face PILOT’S VOICE  Hold onto your hats...
##### AND HE RUNS.... ACROSS THE LAWNS, PAST SOLDIERS AND WRECKAGE, PAST BLONSKY’S BODY, HIS STRIDES LENGTHENING WITH EACH STEP SMASHING INTO THE TREES AND OUT OF FRAME INTO THE DARK.
ROSS: You did the right thing calling us.
##### 
ROSS: You’re doubting it now because it went bad but your instincts were right. You see who he is now...what he is. SAMSON No, I don’t actually. He wasn’t what I thought he’d be at all. It was strange to me that she would never say what had happened between them...she’s one of the most honest people I know. But it was this, wasn’t it? And you knew about it too...you were all a part of it? ROSS I need to know where they’re going. She’ll be in incredible danger as long as she’s with him. SAMSON From who? He protected her. You almost killed her. ROSS I give you my word that her safety is my main concern at this point. Bruce’s as well. I care about him more than you realize. I don’t want to hurt him, I want to help him. SAMSON You know it’s a point of professional pride with me that I can always tell when somebody is lying. He wasn’t...and you are. But I don’t know where he was going. I know that she’ll help him if she can.
##### 
ROSS: Then she’ll be aiding a fugitive and I won’t be able to help either of them. Ross walks out the driveway to his waiting van. SAMSON I used to wonder why she never talked about you...now I know. Ross walks away without looking back. Hulk emerges from the trees in the rain holding Betty Hulk spies a cave opening in the rocks... HULK lays her gently down inside the opening out of the rain. This wakes Betty and, disoriented she reacts in terror to the monstrous face next to hers... SHE SCREAMS AND PUNCHES HIM reflexively...HE GROWLS surprised. BETTY Oh no...I’m sorry...I’m... But he is already standing up. He can't fit under the roof so stands in the entrance.
##### 
You’re hurt.: BETTY And as we slide across behind the head REALITY MORPHS into HULK’S VISION...hallucinatory, distorted. BETTY fractured into two, the SOUND OF RAIN like an acid sizzle, etc... BETTY Bruce, can you understand me? Are you hurt? Betty’s voice cuts through the bad Trip he's on and things actually settle and straighten out a bit but then... WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING...seen still in our HULK VIEW. Supercharged, annihilating, terrifying.
##### BETTY (CONT’D) It’s okay...we’re okay. She steps out in the rain and touches his arm and he turns, still growling... She takes his massive hand BETTY (CONT’D) Come here... come on. She pulls him down out of the rain and he huffs and sits down and she sits with him. She sits with him calming him. FROM WIDE OUTSIDE THE CAVE we can see the outline of the two of them sitting together in the dark, lightning pops a flash on the image of the woman and the monster sitting together....BLACKOUT. ROSS Will he walk again?
DOCTOR: Most of the bones in his body look like crushed gravel right now. If he lives he’ll be lucky if he can lift the straw to eat his liquid meals. They come to BLONSKY’s BED. He has every tube imaginable in him. DOCTOR I will say this, he’s got a heart like a machine. Never seen anything like it outside a race horse. Bruce and Betty wake up in the cave. He tries to rise and retches. Bruce has scars all over his body where the Hulk’s wounds were made.
##### Appalachia or maybe the Smokies. Some little nowhere town in the mountains. BETTY is coming along the ground floor units with a KEY. Bruce emerges from behind the ice machine, wearing her coat over his nude torso and shredded pants. She helps him into the room. Banner emerging from the shower, a towel around him. Bathroom full of steam. No sign of Betty. THE HULK’S FACE SNARLS AT HIM -- A FLASH of Hulk-Memory of the GUNSHIP ROUNDS coming at him No more than a flash but it doubles him over the sink. The door the room opens and Betty comes in with a number of SHOPPING BAGS. She hears... BANNER THROWING UP in the bathtub. She waits, concerned. He emerges. BETTY Still feeling sick?
BRUCE: No, I feel better. Getting my data back. He holds up the little data Flash Card. It worked. BETTY I think I’ve got a good selection for you. First things first... She tosses him a new PULSE MONITOR. BRUCE You’re kidding me... BETTY
##### ain’t Armani but... He puts it on as she starts showing him clothes. She holds up a large pair of STRETCHY PURPLE PANTS
BRUCE: I’m an irradiated freak, that doesn’t mean I’ve lost my sense of style. He changes. His hair is an unkempt mess. BETTY When was the last time anybody but you cut your hair, Mr. Style Council?
##### BETTY (CONT’D) I have done this before. He drops his head forward, letting her rub his neck a little.
BETTY: I don’t know how you’ve done this alone. BRUCE With clippers usually...No, I didn’t want you to be afraid all the time. BETTY It is frightening. But it was worse not knowing... He twists around and THEY ARE KISSING and it all breaks loose. He PUSHES HER TOWARD THE BED AND ONTO IT and MOVES ON TOP OF HER
##### 
BRUCE: No, wait...I’m sorry... What...? BETTY BRUCE We can’t... BETTY It’s okay...I want to. BRUCE No... I can’t. I can’t get too...excited. She understands now. They want to and know it but they can’t.
##### 
BETTY: Not even a little excited? Banner studies her face, he’s imagined this moment so many times. BRUCE I thought I couldn’t risk this...that it was better to deal with it alone. But it wasn’t...this is better. I wanted so much to...it was so hard just to move from place to place...so risky. I sent you small things to try to let you know... I sent you a Canthia Tigris from Brazil. I don’t know if... I got it. BETTY BRUCE I’m so sorry...so sorry... She stops him and shakes her head and kisses him. Ross is at a desk off the open room of a Strategic Operations Command Center. The desks on the floor are empty. Ross is up late alone. A WALL-MOUNTED TV is tuned to NEWS, reporting the dramatic battle. SOME FOOTAGE OF AN EXPLOSION SEEN FROM A NEWSCOPTER FAR AWAY. A TV NEWS REPORTER reporting live from the edge of the campus runs over the following dialogue.

##### 
REPORTER: Further search for the mysterious ‘Hulk’ was delayed by powerful thunderstorms in the Smoky Mountain National forest.
##### More than healed, HE LOOKS STRONGER THAN EVER, literally. THE SUPER-SOLDIER SERUM IS TURNING HIM INTO AN ADONIS. Blonsky is grinning like a cat. Astounded Ross shakes his hand.
Sir.: BLONSKY ROSS Good to see you on your feet, Soldier. How do you feel? BLONSKY Pissed off and ready for Round 3.
##### 
BANNER: Can’t use any of it but the cash. Don’t even turn the phone on, they can track it.
##### 
BETTY: My lipstick? Can they track that? BANNER No you can keep that. BETTY Not going to get where we’re going on 70 bucks. BANNER Not quickly enough. Betty turns and reaches for a small chain around her throat, pulls up A GOLD PENDANT. Takes it off. BANNER No. It’s the only thing of hers that you have. No. BETTY We’ll get it back. Ross has a real team assembled now. Technicians, intel, law- enforcement. All of it. There are at least two dozen people in the room and Cabot is wrapping up the briefing. Ross stands to the side. BANNER and BETTY’S PHOTOS FILLS THE SCREEN CABOT ...Federal is already monitoring phone, plastic and Dr. Ross’s web accounts, and local PD’s have been put on alert... They’ll pop up somewhere and when they do it comes straight to us... ROSS They won’t just pop up. He made it five years and got across borders without making a mistake and he won’t use a damn credit card now. If he was trying to escape he’d be long gone. But he’s not trying to escape...he’s looking for help. And that’s how we’re going to get him. We don’t know where they’re going but we know what they’re after and we know he’s been talking to somebody. You’ve all got copies of that correspondence. There are only a few hundred people in world who have what he needs. Figure out who they are, he’s going to one of them.
##### 
CABOT: Under no circumstances whatsoever are your people to engage these subjects directly. Apprehension will be handled exclusively from this office. Call it in and we’ll tell you what to do. Betty exiting with cash. She pawned her mother’s locket. BETTY We’ll get it back. Bruce and Betty with a “FOR SALE” sign in their hands, buying something in cash from the YOUNG GUY behind the counter. The GUY is on a computer. Banner offers the guy $50. BANNER Mind if I send a quick email off your account? Guy takes the money happily and Banner quickly plugs in the data card and sends a message to Mr. Blue/Sterns.
##### Betty and Bruce getting into their newly purchased BATTERED OLD PICKUP TRUCK. Bruce getting in the passenger side...
Hey...: BETTY He turns and she has her little camera out. He gives her a quizzical look. BETTY It’s been worse than this before right? BRUCE Yes...much worse. BETTY Then we’re on the way to something better. He smiles a sad uncertain smile and she SNAPS THE PICTURE.
##### Betty drives. Banner stares out in to the dark, a darker mood back on him.
BETTY: Penny for your thoughts. BANNER How long have you known Samson? About a year lecture on a Do you trust BETTY and a half. He came to fellowship and stayed. BANNER him? BETTY Yes. I do. Bruce, you know that I... BANNER You don’t have to explain anything to me. Ever. He seems like a good man and he treats you well and that makes me happy. BETTY He does. I never trusted him with this. Trust isn’t the right word. I didn’t test his faith in me by asking him to believe something I still can’t believe myself. BANNER Who could? Sometimes I even convince myself it’s not real. BETTY What is it like...when it happens? What do you experience? BANNER Remember those clinical experiments we volunteered for at Harvard? The induced hallucinations? It’s like that, amplified by a thousand. It feels like someone is pouring a liter of acid into my brain. The sound is the worst. BETTY Do you remember anything? BANNER Fragments. Nothing I can derive anything from.
##### 
BETTY: But then it’s still you...inside it. BANNER It’s not me. BETTY In the cave, I felt that you knew...that IT knew me. Maybe your mind is in there it’s just...overcharged...can’t process what’s happening. You know Samson works with people on ‘conscious dreaming’, helping them direct themselves out of their nightmares even though the conscious brain seems asleep... maybe... BANNER I don’t want to control it. I want to get rid of it. It kills people. It almost killed you. I didn’t do those things. BETTY Of course not... He looks out the window in silence, tormented. Blonsky sits on the table. TWO MEDICAL TECHS are prepping the syringes that we saw deliver Blonsky his first dose of Super Soldier serum. He’s getting more.
##### HIGH PEAKS of the HIMALAYAS; a rocky path leading up to us and on it a MONK in saffron and red robes. He looks up at us and holds up a hand in greeting and SMILES.
BETTY: I thought I should let you sleep. BANNER Where are we? BETTY Stuck in traffic. But getting close. He looks around. Traffic lockup. Radio talking about traffic delays due to heightened security alert. He opens the door and stands up to look.
##### 
Let’s go.: Go where? We’ve got to get out. BANNER BETTY BANNER BETTY Right here...I mean...now? BANNER Yes, right here....let’s go.
##### Banner and Betty walk down the sidewalk and we pan and see that they are heading for the WATER’S EDGE. BANNER and BETTY talking to an OLDER GUY standing by a rail with a fishing pole and bucket (Stan Lee!). They’re offering him some money and he’s nodding. Betty and Bruce on the sidewalk by a kiosk with a map
BETTY: Long way uptown. Subway’s quickest. BANNER Me in a tight metal tube underground with hundreds of other people in the most aggressive city in the world? BETTY Right. Let’s get a cab. SCREAMING up 6th Avenue. The DRIVER is without a doubt the most terrifying cab driver in a whole city of bad cab drivers. Slashing across two lanes, accelerating like an F-1 racer, braking and honking nearly killing a bike messenger, racing through yellow lights from much too far away. All with RADIO BLARING and on CELL PHONE talking a mile a minute.
##### SLAM! Betty and Banner have bailed on Hell Ride. Betty hurling money in increments through the passenger window.
BETTY: ...god forbid you should give a SHIT about the living, breathing PEOPLE in the back of your office on wheels with no SHOCKS... DRIVER What’s the matter baby? You no like a good ride? He makes a kiss noise and takes off. Betty BOOTS the rear panel as he goes
##### 
Asshole!!: BETTY BRUCE You know I can show you some techniques to help you manage that rage a little better... BETTY Zip it. We’re walking. Banner and Betty walk up along the Park past the Natural History Museum. CABOT in a glassed-in office off the OPEN ROOM full of desks and terminals. AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER walks in with a file OFFICER That’s from Quantico. They’re getting blanked. The academic language in the published stuff could be three dozen off our list. And we haven’t even got samples for three dozen more.
##### 
STERNS: “...full cell saturation, a method of moving desired compounds into every cell in the body which will revolutionize medical therapies.”
##### In front of our eyes, the student starts to TURN BLUE. PEOPLE laugh and clap at the demonstration. STUDENT (O.S.) What’s his name? STERNS Who, Mr. Blue here? A Google link appears for Columbia University. Cabot clicks on the link and uploads a photo of Professor JR Sterns, the same man in the You Tube video. CABOT BURSTS INTO THE DOORWAY OF HER OFFICE
CABOT: They’re going to New York!! INT/EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCIENCE BUILDING LOBBY - DAY Professor Sterns emerges. BETTY Excuse me, Dr Sterns? Yes. STERNS BETTY Sorry to bother you. I’m Elizabeth Ross. STERNS Dr. Ross, my goodness...I read your wonderful paper on synthesizing nucleotides!! To what do I owe the... BETTY There’s someone I’d like to introduce you Mr Green! The lab has a bit of the ‘Mad Scientist’ clutter to it. Sterns speaks very quickly. to... Mr. Blue, I presume. BANNER STERNS
##### 
STERNS: ...it took some work, let me tell you, we’ve never tried to concentrate the trimethodine a tenth of what your peak exposure correlates with. That you survived an event like that to stand here and discuss this....it has something to do with Dr. Ross’s protein primer capacitating the cells of course, but it’s beyond my reckoning...we could study it for years. BETTY But you think you’ve got the concentration right? STERNS Well yes...on paper anyway. And my cell saturation will make sure we don’t miss any spots...but...even if we hit the levels right, I can’t promise this will cure you. It might only be an antidote to suppress the specific flare up. When you have one of these ‘spikes’ ... is the experience extreme? BANNER You might say that. STERNS Well I can’t wait to see it! You know I must say...I wondered if you were real. And if you were I wondered what it would look like...a person with that much power lurking in him. Nothing could have surprised me more than this unassuming young man shaking my hand!  I’d be remiss however if I didn’t point out that these concentrations carry extraordinary levels of toxicity. If we’re over by even a small integer, the residual could kill you. Will kill you. BANNER There’s a flip side to that ... if we miss on the low side...if we induce me and it fails...it will be very dangerous for you. STERNS I’ve always been more curious than cautious. It’s served me well so far but if that’s what kills this cat in the end...well at least I’ll have peeked around a few corners.  
##### STERNS (CONT'D) So then we’re all agreed?
CABOT: If we can’t hit him unaware before he makes the street then plainclothes will try to follow and we stand down. Under no circumstance is Banner to be engaged directly. If we can’t get a shot we fall back and let him go. BLONSKY And if he goes nuclear? ROSS Then we’ll have failed to learn from our mistakes, won’t we? You’ve got the compact sonics. Try to at least move him out of the city center toward the river. Then disengage. We’ll follow from the air but not fight. Any questions? BLONSKY Not much of a rematch. CABOT 1.5 Million people within a five mile radius. You want to fight that thing here? Cabot steps to the front of the cabin, sits near Ross. CABOT  You sure about your boy? ROSS I need a dog in the hunt that’s not going to run from a bear if it shows up. If we do this right, I’ll never have to let him off the leash. Sterns and Betty make the preparations to ‘treat’ Banner. There is a table that looks disturbingly like a set-up for a lethal injection. A little bit of a Frankenstein vibe too. Banner strips to his lycra shorts and gives his clothes to Betty. BANNER Think of all the money I’ll save on wardrobe if this works. If this starts to go bad, promise me you won’t stay and try to help me. Bruce... BETTY
##### 
BANNER: It’s the worst when it starts. You have to promise me you’ll run or I can’t do this. Betty nods. Sterns indicates the nylon medical restraints. STERNS If you have a strong reaction these will keep you from hurting yourself. BANNER If I have a strong reaction you’re not going to need to worry about me. Banner climbs on the table. Sterns tilts it back so that Banner is still at a slight angle and begins to strap him in. Sterns puts an I.V. in each of Banner’s arms and legs linked to the CELL SATURATION MACHINE which he primes. A canister with the antidote and some sort of futuristic spinner or plunger to send it through his body. Then he puts contact pads connected to electrical wires on Banner’s temples. And finally a plastic bite suppressor for Banner’s mouth. Banner shakes it off. Ready? STERNS STERNS JOLTS BANNER WITH ELECTRICITY. A lot of it. It hits him and HIS WHOLE BODY SPASMS, every muscle in his body straining against the straps, eyes clenched and then -
##### A PULSE OF GREEN in the base of his skull sends green Gamma energy shooting through his body, HIS SKIN FLOODS WITH COLOR FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, SPREADING FROM THE BASE OF HIS SKULL AS THE GAMMA ENERGY SHOOTS OUT OF HIS BRAIN.
My God...!: STERNS BETTY There’s more. Wait for it! Now we see the full agony of it as Banner’s body starts to swell and stretch and harden. We should feel the trauma of it on his bones and muscles. Sterns is staggered. Betty watches the man she loves be tortured in front of her, he howls in agony. Sterns steps closer...too close. The restraints pop like rubber bands, one of them striking Sterns who gets knocked back and dazed...The Hulk is appearing on the table, still in spasms.
##### 
STERNS: I’m inclined to think the latter because none of our test subjects had a decline in absorption capacity, but of course they were getting Gamma in MUCH lower doses externally each time... But You! It’s like you’ve got a turbo booster in your brain. It’s one of the most wonderful things I’ve ever seen! BETTY It’s not wonderful for Bruce. STERNS In a medical science sense, of course. You’re miraculous. BETTY So how did you know it would work? STERNS I didn’t. But now that we have the data on Bruce’s initial - BANNER Wait. You said ‘test subjects’. What test subjects? Sterns gestures and they follow him to a door. Sniper teams take roof positions around Sterns lab building. Each team with one shooter and one spotter with a THERMAL SCANNER. SCANNERS springing on line. A THERMAL IMAGE of Betty, Banner and Sterns moving from one part of the lab into another. CABOT  Target is the tallest, in the middle. Night. No civilians. AN NYPD SWAT OFFICER is hustling a SECURITY GUARD OUT OF THE LOBBY. Blonsky and his team move into positions in LOBBY. BLONSKY near the stairwell.
##### 
BANNER: Oh my god... what have you been doing? STERNS Well you didn’t send me much of yourself to work with and I couldn’t risk blowing the opportunity so we concentrated it and grew more. The same thing you were trying to do with the corablanca! You were my flower, see?
##### 
STERNS: A lot of the first pass didn’t survive of course but as you can see we’re doing much better. And we’re only giving them very low-dose Gamma so no power-lifters yet but the interesting thing... BANNER You’ve got to destroy all of it. STERNS Sorry, what... BANNER All of it. Right now. Show me your supply. STERNS You must be joking. We’ll share a Nobel for this, the three of us! Think of the applications. BANNER It doesn’t matter if it can’t be controlled...You don’t know the power of what we’re dealing with here! STERNS But we’ve got the antidote now!
##### 
CABOT: At your discretion shooter.
##### 
Almost...: SHOOTER
##### 
SHOOTER: No shot.
##### SOLDIER (OVER RADIO) Blonsky’s going in...he’s going in! ROSS Blonsky! Stand down! Blonsky takes entire flights in a jump easily. He goes up eight stories in seconds. CABOT (OVER RADIO) Shooter, be advised...
Almost...: SHOOTER BANNER They don’t want the antidote! They want a weapon. They want it to fight for them and if they get it then we lose control of it! STERNS Oh look I hate the government too but you’re being a little paranoid don’t you th---? CRUNCH! The sound of something fast going through glass.
##### A TRANQ DART IN THE BACK OF HIS NECK. Sterns screams, backs away from the window. Banner’s eyes widen. SHOOTER (OVER RADIO) Target is hit...Dart onboard. BANNER Get out now. Blonsky SHOVES HER...too hard, his strength abnormal...and she is knocked five feet before hitting the ground on her arm, crying out in pain. Blonsky looks at him, his eyes boring into
BLONSKY: Come on! COME ON!! WHERE IS IT?! OTHER SOLDIERS burst through the lab door. Banner’s... GUN BUTT SOLDIER BLONSKY CRACKS BANNER IN THE HEAD with his BLONSKY!!! Street running along north end of Columbia campus, behind Sterns’ building. Street closed off by police vehicles.
##### BLACK
CABOT: Never seen anyone come round from a tranq dose like that. Why the hell aren’t we keeping him under? ROSS You want to be the one to stick a needle in his arm that he doesn’t want? She’s our best insurance. Keep her right next to him...He knows if he pops off it’s her that gets hurt. CABOT What do you want to do with Sterns? ROSS I want him pinned in that lab with you. Don’t let him leave the room to piss until he’s identified every bottle, every box, every machine in the place. Then package it up and get it back home. Then get aiding and abetting charges and get him turned over to us. If Banner won’t give us answers maybe we can get him to. CABOT nods and heads into the building.
##### Betty, following, ROSS PUTS A HAND ON HER ARM AND STOPS HER.
Betty...: ROSS BETTY I will never forgive what you have done to him. And to me. ROSS He is a fugitive. He made choices and I have a responsibility... BETTY You made him a fugitive! To cover your failures and save your career. He told me what you said to him after the accident, before I woke up...what you proposed. That’s why he ran and gave up...
##### 
ROSS: His work...his blood...is the property of the United States Army and my Duty supersedes my personal feelings in this matter. BETTY Truth Justice and the American Way... ROSS Something like that. BETTY You have to start with Truth or the rest of it doesn’t work. Don’t speak to me as your daughter. Not ever again. She moves up the ramp... ROSS It’s only because you’re my daughter that you’re not in handcuffs too. An ARMY RANGER SENTRY outside the doors. CABOT QUESTIONING STERNS who sits in a chair. CABOT ...then it’s not the same. STERNS Not exactly no, but it could be better. What happened to him was a freak accident. We’ve sorted out some of the pieces but I don’t think I could put together the same Humpty Dumpty just yet if you follow me... CABOT I don’t want to know if you can make another one I want to know if Banner’s the only serious threat at the.... THUNK. CABOT JERKS A LITTLE, EYES ROLL BACK, AND SHE SLUMPS. BLONSKY STANDS BEHIND HER IN SHADOW, HE HIT HER IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE. STERNS Jeez, what is it with you hitting people all the ti---? CLICK! BLONSKY’S PISTOL IS OUT AND COCKED IN STERNS’ FACE.
##### 
STERNS: What could I have possibly done to deserve this? BLONSKY It’s not what you’ve done. It’s what you’re going to do. STERNS Well I like your use of future tense in that sentence anyway. BLONSKY I want what you got out of Banner. STERNS You’ve got it! Before you knocked the Major out I told her I’ll help in any way as long as I can... BLONSKY I want it in me. STERNS You look like you’ve got a little something extra in you already, don’t you. BLONSKY I want more. You saw what he becomes? STERNS I did. It’s beautiful...God-like. But I can’t make you like that... I don’t know what’s in you...the mix could be something terrible. BLONSKY BENDS AND GRABS STERNS BY THE FRONT OF HIS JACKET WITH ONE HAND, LIFTING HIM EASILY, PLACING THE GUN UNDER HIS CHIN. STERNS I’m not unwilling I just need ‘informed consent’...and you’ve given it! The Sikorsky cuts through the air over the Hudson River. Bruce and Betty sit across from each other toward the rear. ARMED SOLDIERS flanking them. ROSS up toward the front with COMMUNICATIONS OFFICERS and a BANK OF MONITORS.
##### Bruce and Betty stare at each other. She takes his hand, holds it. Low, looking up at the building. A few of BLONSKY’S DELTA TEAM and a couple NYPD keep the area on lockdown.
SOLDIER 2: ...ten feet and green...You’re getting your news off Inside Edition. “The Hulk”... gimme a break... SOLDIER ...telling you, whatever went down it shook Tommy up...he said be heads up on this one. SOLDIER 2 Only action we’re gonna see is those blue- shirts bringing each other coffee... BOOM!!! AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF THE BUILDING FROM STERNS’ LAB, FLAME AND STONE RAINING DOWN. SOLDIERS AND COPS HIT THE DECK.
##### SOLDIER (OVER RADIO) Delta 4 to Leader, something big just went off down here!
ROSS: This is Ross. What went off? SOLDIER The whole floor just blew out Blonsky, Stoller, Robertson and the Major...they were all still up there!! ROSS Get our teams moving back there and get PD Special Units out... Turn us around... THE HELICOPTER BANKS SHARPLY
##### BANNER We’re going back... The Sikorsky banks hard and turns back into the eye of the storm. THE SOLDIERS AND COPS have taken positions covering the lobby of the building SOLDIER 2 I’m going up... He rises to dash to the lobby when CRASH!! The sound of something huge crashing into a car out on AN UNBELIEVABLE ROAR OF RAGE. They’re eyes on the narrow space between the Lab Building and the one to its left...out toward the street where IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS, AN ENORMOUS, HULKING GRAY FORM SURGES PAST. AT LEAST 14 FEET TALL. Soldiers and cops look at each other...”What the..?” THEY DASH FOR THE STREET, and turn to the left in time to see THE MASSIVE GREY BACK OF THE THING DISAPPEARING TO THE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER, UP BROADWAY.
COP 1: What in God’s name was that? Soldier 1 keys mic The Hulk’s in the street! SOLDIER 1
##### the hell are we? 120TH AND BROADWAY, HEADING UP BROADWAY!!
ROSS: Hold it together, soldier! Have any of you got a live feed? Yeah... SOLDIER 1 SOLDIER 1
##### 
ROSS: Then stay with it and get me a visual, we’ve got help on the way. Now get moving! SOLDIER 1 activates his mini helmet battle camera SOLDIER 1 C’mon!! ALL FOUR RUN TOWARD A PARKED OPEN-TOP HUMVEE SOLDIER 1  Can you drive this thing? COP 1 Marines, 8 years. Let’s go. The TWO SOLDIERS AND TWO COPS jump in TO THE RIGHT AND MAKE A QUICK LEFT UP FLAMES FLICKERING, SMOKE. A CANISTER FROM THE SATURATION MACHINE, FULL OF BLOOD, DRIPPING DOWN ONTO...
##### 
ROSS: Goddam it I said get me eyes on that thing! and fire up. THEY PEEL OUT AMSTERDAM.
##### BANNER moves toward Ross... the SOLDIER STOPS HIM
Sit down!: SOLDIER BANNER Shoot me...let’s see what happens. BANNER SHOVES PAST HIM AND UP NEXT TO ROSS AT THE MONITORS, BETTY FOLLOWS.
##### Still from a distance, A MASSIVE GREY CREATURE IS CAUSING HAVOC. Pedestrians flee in panic, cars skidding and trying to turn around. STREET COPS fire on the CREATURE -- IT RIPS A LIGHTPOLE OFF THE CORNER AND SWATS THEM ASIDE LIKE MOSQUITOS
SOLDIER 1: Sir are you seeing this? What the hell is that? Is that Banner? ROSS No. Is it Sterns? CABOT General, it’s Blonsky. Sterns is dead... It’s Blonsky. TIGHTER ON THE CREATURE, first good look at it from the front. 14 FEET TALL, GRAY, AS HEAVILY MUSCLED AS HULK BUT WITH STRANGE BONES PROTRUDING LIKE SPURS AT ITS ANKLES AND WRISTS
##### 
ROSS: Hit it with whatever you’ve got, try to draw it after you and get it to the river. We’ve got cutters on both sides of the island with sonic! ABOMINATION IS HAVING A FIELD DAY, REVELLING IN DESTRUCTION. SOLDIER 1 drops to the floor, prying open a large compartment. SOLDIER 2 What are you doing? SOLDIER 1 You think a rifle’s gonna hurt that? Blonsky told me he put in some ordinance... HE COMES UP WITH A ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER. SOLDIER 1  That’s what I’m talking about, G! He spins, flips the sight up, flips off the safety and throws it on his shoulder SOLDIER 1  Now say ‘good night, Gracie’... FIRES. THE ABOMINATION TURNS AS THE RPG STREAKS DOWN THE STREET, TRAILING SMOKE, STRAIGHT AT THE MONSTER’S HEAD... SNATCH! LIKE A CAT THE ABOMINATION GRABS THE MISSILE STRAIGHT OUT OF THE AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT THEM...AND SMASHES IT AGAINST HIS OWN FOREHEAD WHERE IT EXPLODES ABOMINATION LEERS AT THEM. HE’S ENJOYING THIS. Time to go! SOLDIER 2 The cop at the wheel hits reverse and floors it, COP in front, and BOTH SOLDIERS whip up their weapons and POUR FIRE IN ON ABOMINATION, CHARGING STRAIGHT AT THEM, TAKING BULLETS LIKE HE’S RUNNING THROUGH A LIGHT RAIN. HE CLOSES ON THEM, RAISING A MASSIVE ARM... AT THE SAME MOMENT THE HUMVEE SLAMS INTO A CAR COMING UP AMSTERDAM ACROSS THE INTERSECTION AND THE ABOMINATION SEIZES IT BY THE HOOD, HEAVES IT UP ,TWISTS IT SIDEWAYS AND SMASHES IT TO THE GROUND, OVER AND OVER...METAL, HELMETS, BODIES FLYING.
##### The same TERRIBLE CAB DRIVER that terrorized Bruce and Betty, speeding up the avenue, he can see the light ahead is green but traffic is slowed up ahead. Light goes yellow...
DRIVER: This is bullshit, people!! He FLOORS IT, cuts to the side and races through the light turning red straight into... ABOMINATION -- WHO SIMPLY TURNS, HAMMERS HIS FOOT DOWN INTO THE HOOD OF THE CHARGING CAB, JACKING IT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE AIR, WHERE HE GRABS IT BY THE UNDERCARRIAGE AND SMASHES IT INTO THE MANGLED HUMVEE LIKE TWO PIECES OF BREAD BEING SMACKED TOGETHER. HE ROARS, EXULTING IN HIS INVINCIBILITY, SCATTERING TERRIFIED PEOPLE FROM THEIR CARS WHICH THEY ABANDON.
##### COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER General, NYPD wants to know what to use against it, SAC has that A-10 in the air and ready... What do you want me to tell them? .... Sir?
BETTY: The sound waves stopped it at the campus...they stopped Bruce... ROSS They need an open field of fire, there’s too much down there to absorb them...too many places to hide... BANNER You can’t stop it, you have to kill it. ROSS And what do you propose, a bomb? How big should it be, you tell me! BANNER You have to take me back there.
##### 
No...: It’s the only thing the only thing that ROSS Forget it, if I put won’t fight, you’ll BETTY BANNER that can stop it. I’m can stop it. you down there you run. BANNER We made that thing, you and I!! We’ve got to try something! I think you were right, it’s still me. I heard you on the table calling to me and I held on... BETTY You think you can control it? BANNER No but maybe I can aim it. ROSS What if you just double my problem? BANNER Have you got a better idea? ROSS Put us near it. Get those cuffs off him. BANNER No... Open the door. Do it! Ross nods and the soldier hits the button and the huge REAR RAMP of the helicopter starts to hinge open, COOL NIGHT AIR RUSHES IN. Bruce moves toward the back, still in his wrist shackles. BANNER  Put me over it! Go higher! They surge upward...climbing, the city dropping away. Bruce looks out the open door of the Chinook, the city 3000 feet below. BETTY Oh my god, no...what are you doing?! You don’t even know if you’ll turn! BANNER I tried to do this a long time ago, when I thought I’d killed you. It wouldn’t let me.
##### 
BETTY: This is too risky, it’s insane! BANNER I know, but I have to try. I’m sorry. He takes a deep breath, kisses her AND FALLS OUT THE DOOR.
##### And he falls away from us, becoming smaller and smaller, plunging toward the street until we can barely see him and then...far below... A small FLASH OF GREEN. Looking up, something PLUNGES DOWN out of the dark, SPEEDING DOWN THROUGH THE FRAME...there might have been a greenish glow as it... CRASHES THROUGH THE STREET, leaving a very deep, rough hole. REVERSE ON the hole as A MIGHTY GREEN HAND AND ARM RISE UP, crushing the stone of the street to create a grip, muscles flexing, hauling up a great weight... TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from the Abomination, looking over their shoulders, coming straight at us. One looks forward to see where he’s going and STOPS IN HORROR at the sight of THE HULK, pulling himself out of the hole. On his hands and knees, Hulk looks up at the terrified guy and ROARS. CAMERA CONTINUES TO ROLL AROUND HULK’S HEAD as we see all this, landing back on his face where we see and really understand by now the AGONY FOR BANNER OF BEING INSIDE HULK’S BRAIN... ...but something new happens. HULK GRIMACES AT THE CHAOS OF IT ALL, CLOSES HIS EYES AND STRAINS AND ROARS, SHAKING HIS HEAD AS IF TO CLEAR IT...LOOKS UP... Among the last of the fleeing people emptying the street, A HARLEM LOUDMOUTH, hustling and protesting at the same time
LOUDMOUTH: ...tired of this shit! Show me some motherfuckin’ fifteen foot monster buggin’ out in the WHITE man’s neighborhood, somebody’d be... He turns and sees HULK...stops cold...Looks back at Abomination... He scoots. LOUDMOUTH Oh, I see...it’s a family thing. I’m gonna let you all work this out. HULK STARES AT ABOMINATION’S BACK, STANDS TALL AND FLEXES AND ROARS...and it SHAKES THE STREET. ABOMINATION TURNS...SEES HIM. EYES FLARE...RECOGNITION.
##### HULK and ABOMINATION ACCELERATING TOWARD EACH OTHER. AND THEY COLLIDE, LIKE TWO ELEPHANTS BEING SHOT TOGETHER THE COLLISION EMITS A SOUND LIKE A THUNDERCLAP AND THE SHEER FORCE OF IT BLOWS OUT THE GLASS AND LIGHTS OF THE MARQUEE ON THE APOLLO THEATER AND SURROUNDING STOREFRONTS. ABOMINATION HAS HIM FROM BEHIND, A CHOKE HOLD. HULK DROPS A KNEE AND LEVERS THE OPPOSITE SHOULDER, HEAVING ABOMINATION THROUGH THE FRONT OF A CIRCUIT CITY SUPERSTORE... ABOMINATION crashes headfirst through the glass doors and his head goes straight into the stairs of an escalator, his shoulders splitting the hand rails apart as TERRIFIED NIGHTTIME SHOPPERS DIVE AWAY. ABOMINATION pulls his head out of the NOW BROKEN ESCALATOR STAIR BELT AND SEIZES IT BY A BROKEN END ABOMINATION emerges from the store with THE SERRATED STEEL ESCALATOR STAIR AS A FEARSOME WHIP HE SLINGS IT AT HULK, SLICING LIGHTPOLES OFF AS IT ROLLS OUT AND SLASHES HULK ACROSS HIS UPRAISED ARMS AND SHOULDERS. THE GUNSHIP ARCING LOW OVER HARLEM Ross and Betty watch from above, as the Pilot tries to stay with the fight WHIPPING AT HIM A SECOND TIME BUT HULK IS UNDER IT NOW, CATCHING IT AS IT HISSES OVER, SPINNING HIS WEIGHT AGAINST IT AND FLINGING ABOMINATION INTO A BRICK WALL, ONLY TO HAVE ABOMINATION SNAP IT FROM UP TO DOWN SO THAT A NASTY WAVE ROLLS THROUGH IT CRACKING THE END UP AND INTO HULK’S FACE, KNOCKING HIM ON HIS BACK. AND ABOMINATION IS ON HIM AND BEATING HIM WITH HORRIBLE BLOWS... CRABBING UP, HULK GETS HIS FEET UP UNDER HIM, ROLLS BACKWARD AND FLIPS ABOMINATION UNDER HIM NOW, IMMEDIATELY RETURNING HORRIBLE BLOWS INTO ABOMINATIONS RIBS THAT MAKE HIM HOWL IN PAIN. BUT NOW IT’S ABOMINATION’S TURN TO GET HIS FEET INTO HULK’S TORSO AND HURL HULK WITH THE FULL FORCE OF HIS LEGS A FULL BLOCK IN THE AIR AND INTO THE 4TH FLOOR OF A 16 STORY APARTMENT BUILDING. HE ROLLS OVER AND CHARGES THE BUILDING IN THE WINDOWS WE CAN LITERALLY SEE HULK FALLING DOWN THROUGH THE CEILINGS OF TERRIFIED DWELLERS UNTIL HE HITS THE GROUND FLOOR AGAIN ABOMINATION BURSTS INTO A GROUND FLOOR APT, LOOKING FOR HULK SEES HIM THROUGH THE SMALL DOORWAYS AND BARRELS IN. AS HULK RISES, HE PUNCHES HIM WITH AN UPPERCUT THAT SENDS HIM BACK UP TWO FLOORS. ABOMINATION HAULS HIMSELF UP IN PURSUIT, LOOKS LEFT TO GET KICKED IN THE FACE, BLOWING HIM LATERALLY THROUGH THE WALL, PAST A FAMILY WATCHING TV AND INTO THE NEXT APARTMENT AND OUT THE FAR WALL OF THE BUILDING. THE BONES IN HIS ANKLES GRAB LIKE HOOKS AND PREVENT HIM FROM FALLING AND HE DOES A SIT UP, SEES HULK CHARGING HIM, GRABS THE OUTER WALL AND CLIMBS OUT OF THE WAY USING HIS HANDS TO PULVERIZE HAND-HOLDS IN THE BRICK WALL . HULK LOOKS OUT AND UP AND SCRAMBLES AFTER HIM, CRUSHING HIS OWN HAND-HOLDS AND CLIMBING Looking down, they spot the monsters climbing onto the roof They bank and circle
ROSS: They’re a block north of the university again...can we get a local chopper with a spot on it, maybe we can give him some help. CABOT, battered and shaken limps out onto the sidewalk the HUMVEE departed and looks up at THE SIKORSKY, arcing overhead, above a tall apartment building. A forest of water towers, huge industrial AC units. HULK emerges over the lip of the roof, landing with a THUD QUIET. No sign of Abomination. METAL GROANING. A WATER TOWER SHAKES ON ITS IRON LEGS.
##### Behind Hulk as he steps right to look around the stairwell... nothing. Back left...ABOMINATION. STANDING WITH A 20 FOOT IRON GIRDER IN HIS HANDS LIKE A BASEBALL BAT. TOO FAST. IT CONNECTS -- A HORRIBLE SOUND. LIKE AN ALUMINUM BAT AND IT CREAMS HULK BACK THROUGH THE AIR FULLY OVER THE ROOF OF THE NEXT TWO BUILDINGS AND DOWN, DISAPPEARING WITH MUFFLED CRASH SOMEWHERE 16 STORIES DOWN AND TWO BLOCKS AWAY. Betty gasps... ROSS acts
ROSS: Fire! Give him all of it! And with that the DOOR CANNON JUST BEHIND THE COCKPIT OPENS UP STREAMS OF HIGH CALIBER FIRE STREAKING OUT THROUGH THE DARK ROUNDS POUND INTO ABOMINATION, SOME GLANCING OFF THE PLATELIKE BONES, OTHERS RIPPING THROUGH HIS FLESH PURPLISH BLOOD RISING IN THE WOUNDS HE TURNS, ENRAGED BY THIS NEW ATTACK AND HURLS HIS IRON GIRDER LIKE A JAVELIN IT ROCKETS AT THE HELICOPTER, MISSING BY A HAIR AND DISAPPEARING OUT INTO THE DARK SKY An UPPER EAST SIDE MOM with her YOUNG SON and their DOG, walking north, when A 20 FOOT IRON GIRDER PLUNGES OUT OF THE SKY, CHOPPING ONE OF THOSE RIDICULOUS HUMMER LIMOS IN HALF AND BOUNCING DOWN THE STREET MOM And that is why I tell you, “never go above 96th Street!” She turns them around.
##### HULK sprawled in a huge green DUMPSTER, shaking off stars. He jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START DOWN THE ALLEY AND LEAPS... HULK DOES A PARKOUR MOVE, USING HIS FEET TO RUN UP THE WALL BY BOUNCING OFF EITHER SIDE OF THE CORNER. HULK pops out on the roof. Three blocks away he can see the helicopter pouring fire down onto the roof at his foe. RUNNING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS, LEAPING GAPS IN BUILDINGS AND RISING TO HIGHER ROOFS, USING BOTH HANDS AND FEET TO ACCELERATE HIMSELF PARKOUR-STYLE HE CHARGES - THE SATELLITE DISH, WOBBLED OFF ITS COURSE BY HULK’S HIT, CLIPS THE TAIL ROTOR OF THE SIKORSKY - HULK HITS ABOMINATION SO HARD THAT IT SEEMS TO SNAP HIM ALMOST IN HALF - THE HELICOPTER STARTS ARCING DOWN OUT OF CONTROL
PILOT’S VOICE: I can’t hold it! I gotta put it down! Hang on!! - BETTY CLOSES HER EYES - HULK AND ABOMINATION FLY ON THEIR OWN PARALLEL ARC, BARELY MISSING THE UNDERSIDE OF THE PLUNGING SIKORSKY
##### - HULK AND ABOMINATION PLUNGE OVER THE ROOF OF A UNIVERSITY BUILDING, POUNDING THROUGH THE SUPPORT STRUCTURE OF A HUGE WATER- TOWER ON THE WAY DOWN - THE WATER TOWER TOPPLES - THE HELICOPTER SPINNING WILDLY AROUND ITS MAIN ROTOR BARELY CLEARS A BUILDING, CLIPS THE SIDE OF A LARGE UNIVERSITY HALL AND CRASHES INTO THE CORNER OF A LARGE STONE PLAZA, SURROUNDED BY UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS - HULK AND ABOMINATION CRASH INTO THE SAME PLAZA, PULVERIZING THE STONE AND GOUGING A 100 FOOT LONG GROOVE - THE WATER TOWER CRASHES, HITS THE EDGE OF THE BUILDING, SNAPS THE TANK ITSELF OFF, WHICH PLUMMETS TO THE GROUND AND BURSTS, SENDING THOUSANDS OF GALLONS WASHING OVER HULK AND ABOMINATION AND SEPARATING THEM SLIGHTLY. People in windows and surging into the perimeter to watch. People are starting to CHEER FOR HULK. BUT ABOMINATION BEATS HULK AGAINST A WALL LIKE A BOXER CLINCHES AND STARTS TO CHOKE HULK WITH HIS MASSIVE FOREARM PINNING HIS THROAT AGAINST THE STONE WALL, CRACKING IT; HIS WRIST BONE DIGGING INTO HULK’S NECK. SPARKS BURST IN CASCADES from the shattered Rotors assembly, flying closer and closer to the HUGE SIDE GAS TANKS, torn open and dripping POOLS OF GAS right below Betty.
ROSS Go...GO!!: BETTY can only get halfway out...she sees the flames... BRUCE!! BETTY HULK SEES BETTY TRAPPED IN THE HELICOPTER, SHE’s IN TROUBLE
##### ABOMINATION’S EYES GO WIDE AS HULK SEIZES HIS WRISTS AND WITH RAW POWER SPREADS ABOMINATION’S HANDS AWAY FROM HIS THROAT HULK HEAD-BUTTS AGAIN AND AGAIN, THEN DELIVERS A MASSIVE BLOW TO THE SOLAR PLEXUS, DOUBLING ABOMINATION WHO HE THEN DRIVES HEADFIRST INTO THE WALL HULK SPRINTS FOR BETTY AS THE SPARK HITS THE TANK WITH A WHOOSH OF FLAME HULK ISN’T GOING TO BEAT AN EXPLOSION AND HE SUCKS IN A HUGE BREATH AND BLOWS A TREMENDOUS BLAST OF BREATH AT THE FLAME FROM 15 FEET AWAY, BLOWING IT OUT.
BETTY: Wow. A CRACKING, RATTLING SOUND....Her eyes go wide. And HULK takes A TREMENDOUS BLOW TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD, STAGGERING HIM. HE SPINS... ABOMINATION HAS MADE A CLUB OUT OF A CHAIN RUNNING BETWEEN CONCRETE POSTS, WITH THE POSTS STILL ATTACHED LIKE A MACE BEFORE HULK CAN RECOVER FROM THE BLOW, HE SWINGS AGAIN; THIS TIME HULK DUCKS BUT IT CATCHES HIM IN THE THIGH AND KNEE, WIPING HIS LEGS OUT... A HORRIBLE BONE-CRUNCHING BLOW. HULK TRIES TO RISE, BATTERED...ON ONE KNEE
##### HULK, INTO A SQUAT, RAISES HIS FISTS HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND DRIVES THEM INTO THE GROUND, THE CONCUSSION SO POWERFUL THAT A CRACK EXPLODES VIOLENTLY UP ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE PLAZA SO THAT AS ABOMINATION STEPS TO SWING, HE IS KNOCKED OFF BALANCE, HIS FOOT COMING DOWN IN THE FISSURE AND AS THE CLUB ARCS OVER HULK’S HEAD, MISSING, HE GRABS THE CHAIN, DIVES AND ROLLS FORWARD PAST ABOMINATION, WRAPPING THE CHAIN AROUND HIS ENEMY’S NECK ONCE, TWICE... AND HEAVES BACK ON IT. ABOMINATION’S LEG IS CAUGHT IN THE FISSURE, HULK TWISTING HIM AGAINST THE TRAPPED LEG TO TRAP HIM. DESPITE THE HORRENDOUS TORQUE ON HIS BODY, IT ALMOST SEEMS AS THOUGH ABOMINATION HAS THE BRUTE STRENGTH IN HIS NECK AND BACK TO RESIST... ...THE EYES OF ALL ONLOOKERS GLUED TO THE DEATH MATCH ABOMINATION’S HAND GRABS BEHIND HIM TEARING AT HULK’S FACE AND SHOULDERS, CUTTING FLESH, GOUGING HULK’S EYES HULK DOESN’T FLINCH. HEAVING BACK WITH EVERY FIBRE OF HIS STRENGTH HE LIFTS ONE FOOT AND PLANTS IT INTO ABOMINATION’S SHOULDER...THIS IS THE LETHAL LEVERAGE HE NEEDED. HE PRESSES OUT WITH HIS LEG, REARING BACK AND UP ON THE CHAIN WITH HIS SHOULDERS AND ARMS...BOTH CREATURES HOWL, EVERY VEIN BURSTING. AND THEN WITH A HORRIBLE POPPING AND CRACKING...HULK BREAKS THE ABOMINATION’S NECK, LITERALLY STRETCHING AND TWISTING IT GROTESQUELY ABOMINATION’S EYES FLARE...AND THEN WITH A FINAL KICK...HE SAGS. HULK FALLS BACK, SITTING, HIS FOOT STILL ON THE SHOULDER. HE RISES, SHOVING THE BODY OVER ONTO ITS FACE, AND WITH ONE FOOT PLANTED ON THE HUGE BACK OF HIS ENEMY AND THE MOON SHINING DOWN ON HIM, HE THROWS BACK HIS FISTS AND ROARS HULK SCANS THE RING -- looking for any new threat, face fierce. DARK GREEN BLOOD RUNS IN THICK RIVULETS FROM TEARS ALL OVER HIS BODY... HIS NOSE...HIS GAZE FINDS... Betty. He stops and stares at her. Knows her. BETTY (CONT’D) Shh. It’s over... it’s over.
HULK: Betty. It’s a deep bass rumble, barely a whisper. A tear falls down her cheek and he puts out a finger to catch it. Tired. Eyes almost drooping...
##### 
CABOT: You gotta be kidding me... She DUCKS as he HURDLES OVER HER. Hulk sprints west, crosstown... Pounding the pavement...cars screeching to a halt...people gaping as the Titan flashes past.... ...accelerating...out of the buildings and through the trees at the top end of Riverside Park... Helicopters above tracking him... sound of radio calls trying to keep tabs on him... warning the Coast Guard ship that he’s heading their way... ...and he can see it ... the water of the Hudson River... A COAST GUARD CUTTER on the near shore blocking his path... The spotlight from the POLICE CHOPPER on him now... the Coast Guard cutter swinging it’s own light up to find him as he races toward it, reaches the elevated spans of the West Side Highway... ...and LEAPS...HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET...SOARING HIGH...
##### AND JACKKNIFES INTO THE WATER LIKE A DEPTH CHARGE. In the inky green black of the river... THE HULK SMASHES INTO FRAME FROM ABOVE He rockets through the frame...trailing greenish white bubbles... ...AND DISAPPEARS... as the bubbles fade... TO BLACK. Ross sits on a bar stool in the middle of a mostly empty bar, mid- afternoon. He lifts his drink to his lips, catches his reflection in a mirror behind the bar. Samson sits on the front steps, staring out at the street. He lifts the cordless phone in his hand and dials a number. Betty stands by a railing overlooking the river and the New York Harbor. A FERRY tugs out towards the Statue of Liberty. Her phone rings, she pulls it out and looks at the number, answers.
Hi.: BETTY SAMSON Oh, thank god. You’re alright? When I couldn’t reach you... BETTY I’m not hurt. A lot of people were though. I know, it’s doesn’t seem SAMSON been all over the tv. It real. BETTY It was real. SAMSON Come home. Just come home. BETTY Samson, did you call somebody the night Bruce was at our home? Is that why they came for him? SAMSON I was frightened. Forgive me. BETTY I do. But I’m not coming home yet. SAMSON Where are you going? BETTY I have no idea. But I’ll let you know when I do. I promise. She hangs up. He buries his face in his hands.
##### Betty takes out her camera and looks at the PICTURE SHE TOOK OF BRUCE...THAT SAD, HOPEFUL SMILE. She looks out at the harbor and tries to imagine where he is... EXT/INT - REMOTE EXOTIC LOCATION - DAY He walks to a tidy desk and takes out an envelope from the drawer. He has something in his hand... it’s Betty’s mother’s necklace. He slides it into the envelope and writes her name on it. We’re behind his head now...rolling around him to find him sitting in the lotus position...meditating. Black pants. No shirt. His eyes closed. Pulse monitor on his wrist. Faces the open doors opened out towards the ocean waves. Then, with a deep inhale...his PULSE STARTS TO RISE... Nothing has changed around him, but his pulse is RACING UPWARD...the sound of his heart BEATING FAST RACING OVER 200 WAS THAT A FLASH OF A SMILE?
