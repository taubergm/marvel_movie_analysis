boy,The story of home.,black_panther
man,"Millions of years ago… a meteorite made of vibranium, the strongest substance in the universe, struck the continent of Africa… affecting the plant life around it. And when the time of man came… five tribes settled on it and called it Wakanda. The tribes lived in constant war with each other… until a warrior shaman… received a vision from the Panther Goddess Bast… who led him to the Heart-Shaped Herb… a plant that granted him superhuman strength, speed and instincts. The warrior became king… and the first Black Panther… the protector of Wakanda. Four tribes agreed to live under the king’s rule… but the Jabari Tribe isolated themselves in the mountains. The Wakandans used vibranium to develop technology… more Advanced than any other nation. But as Wakanda thrived… the world around it descended further into chaos. To keep vibranium safe… the Wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight… keeping the Truth of their power from the outside world.",black_panther
boy,"And we still hide, Baba?",black_panther
man,Yes.,black_panther
boy,Why?,black_panther
reporter,"The tiny nation of Wakanda is mourning the death of its monarch, King T’Chaka. The beloved ruler was one of many confirmed dead… after a terrorist Attack at the United Nations a week ago. The suspect has since been apprehended. (Picture of Helmut ZEMO displayed) Though it remains one of the poorest countries in the world… fortified by mountain ranges… and an impenetrable rainforest… Wakanda does not engage in international trade or accept aid. The succession of the throne… is expected to fall to the oldest of the king’s two children… Prince T’Challa.",black_panther

T'challa,Update? No. It worked perfectly.,black_panther
shuri,How many times do I have to teach you? Just because something works doesn’t mean that it cannot be improved.,black_panther

curator,"Also from Benin, seventh century. (CLEARS THROAT) Fula tribe, I believe.",black_panther
erik killmonger,Nah.,black_panther
curator,I beg your pardon?,black_panther
erik killmonger,It was taken by British soldiers in Benin but it’s from Wakanda. And it’s made out of vibranium. (CHUCKLES) Don’t trip. I’mma take it off your hands for you.,black_panther
curator,These items aren’t for sale.,black_panther
erik killmonger,"How do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it, like they took everything else?",black_panther
curator,"Sir, I’m going to have to (CLEARS THROAT) ask you to leave.",black_panther
erik killmonger,You got all this security in here watching me ever since I walked in.,black_panther

ulysses klaue,"Now then, let’s see if you know what you’re talking about. (DEVICE WHIRRING) That’s just a taste. (SNIFFING)",black_panther

T'challa,"Come home, Nakia.",black_panther
Nakia,I’m right here.,black_panther
T'challa,Stay.,black_panther
Nakia,I came to support you and to honor your father… but I can’t stay. I found my calling out there. I’ve seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye. I can’t be happy here… knowing that there’s people out there who have nothing.,black_panther
T'challa,What would you have Wakanda do about it?,black_panther
Nakia,"Share what we have. We could provide aid… and access to technology and refuge to those who need it. Other countries do it, we could do it better.",black_panther
T'challa,"We are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what we truly are… what we possess… we could lose our way of life.",black_panther
Nakia,Wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time.,black_panther
T'challa,"(SIGHS) If you were not so stubborn, you would make a great queen.",black_panther
Nakia,I would make a great queen because I am so stubborn.,black_panther
T'challa,"Ah! See, you admit it.",black_panther
Nakia,If that’s what I wanted.,black_panther
t’challa,"Is that him? Glory to Bast, man. Is he still growing?",black_panther
w’kabi,Of course. I see Nakia is back. You guys going to work it out?,black_panther
t’challa,…,black_panther
w'kabi,What’s wrong?,black_panther
T'challa,Nakia thinks we should be doing more.,black_panther
w'kabi,"More, like what?",black_panther
T'challa,"Foreign aid, refugee programs.",black_panther
w'kabi,"You let the refugees in… they bring their problems with them. And then Wakanda is like everywhere else. Now if you said you wanted me and my men… to go out there and clean up the world, then I’ll be all for it.",black_panther
T'challa,But waging war on other countries has never been our way.,black_panther
T'challa,"You, too, huh?",black_panther
w'kabi,Bast! We’re in trouble.,black_panther
okoye,My King. My love. You will never guess who just popped up on our radar. A misidentified Wakandan artifact… was stolen yesterday from a British museum. We have learned Ulysses Klaue… plans to sell the vibranium to an American buyer… in South Korea… tomorrow night.,black_panther
w'kabi,My parents were killed when he attacked. Not a day goes by when I do not think about what Klaue took from us. From me.,black_panther
T'challa,It’s too great an opportunity to pass.,black_panther
w’kabi,"Take me with you. We’ll take him down together, side by side.",black_panther
T'challa,I need you here protecting the border.,black_panther
w'kabi,Then I ask… you kill him where he stands… or you bring him back to us.,black_panther
T'challa,You have my word. I will bring him back. We will proceed with the mission.,black_panther
shuri,My King!,black_panther
T'challa,Stop it. Stop it.,black_panther
shuri,(CHUCKLES) I’ve already sent a car ahead to Busan for you. Who are you taking with you to Korea?,black_panther
T'challa,Okoye. And Nakia as well.,black_panther
shuri,You sure it’s a good idea to take your ex on a mission?,black_panther
T'challa,"Yes. We’ll be fine. Besides, you’ll be on call should we need backup.",black_panther
shuri,"Yes! I have great things to show you, Brother. Here are your communication devices for Korea. Unlimited range, also equipped with audio surveillance system. Check these out. Remote access Kimoyo Beads. Updated to interface directly with my sand table.",black_panther
t’challa,Ah. And what are these?,black_panther
shuri,The real question is (SHOUTS) what are those?,black_panther
T'challa,(CHUCKLES),black_panther
shuri,Why do you have your toes out in my lab?,black_panther
T'challa,"What, you don’t like my royal sandals? I wanted to go old school for my first day.",black_panther
shuri,I bet the Elders loved that.,black_panther
T'challa,(CHUCKLES),black_panther
shuri,Try them on. Fully automated. Like the old American movie Baba used to watch.,black_panther
t’challa,Mmm.,black_panther
shuri,And I made them completely sound absorbent.,black_panther
T'challa,Interesting.,black_panther
shuri,Guess what I call them. Sneakers. Because you… Never mind. If you’re going to take on Klaue… you’ll need the best the design group has to offer. Exhibit A.,black_panther
t’challa,My design.,black_panther
shuri,Old tech.,black_panther
T'challa,Old?,black_panther
shuri,"Functional, but old. ""Hey, people are shooting at me. Wait, let me put on my helmet.""",black_panther
T'challa,Enough.,black_panther
shuri,"(CHUCKLES) Now, look at these. Do you like that one?",black_panther
T'challa,Tempting. But the idea is to not be noticed. This one.,black_panther
shuri,Now tell it to go on. Ooh! The entire suit sits within the teeth of the necklace. Strike it.,black_panther
T'challa,Anywhere?,black_panther
shuri,"Mmm-hmm. Not that hard, genius!",black_panther
T'challa,You told me to strike it. You didn’t say how hard.,black_panther
shuri,"I invite you to my lab, and you just kick things around?",black_panther
T'challa,"Well, maybe you should make it a little stronger. Hey. Wait a minute.",black_panther
shuri,The nanites absorb the kinetic energy… and hold it in place for redistribution.,black_panther
T'challa,Very nice.,black_panther
shuri,Strike it again in the same spot.,black_panther
T'challa,You’re recording?,black_panther
shuri,For research purposes.,black_panther
T'challa,Delete that footage.,black_panther
Nakia,This way.,black_panther
okoye,"Bast willing, this will go quickly… and I can get this ridiculous thing off my head.",black_panther
Nakia,It looks nice. Just whip it back and forth.,black_panther
okoye,What? It’s a disgrace.,black_panther
Nakia,(IN KOREAN) Hello Sophia. Good to see you.,black_panther

Nakia,(EXCLAIMS) Thank you!,black_panther
T'challa,The woman outside. What trouble was she referring to?,black_panther
Nakia,Ah… I got into a disagreement with some ivory traders. Made a bit of a mess.,black_panther
T'challa,"Hmm. And will there be any trouble tonight, Ms. Kenyan Heiress?",black_panther
Nakia,Depends… on how quickly we finish the mission.,black_panther
okoye,(ON RADIO) Can we please focus? Thank you.,black_panther
Nakia,"(SPEAKING KOREAN) Over here. One whiskey, please. Eyes up. Americans. I count three.",black_panther
okoye,Five. How could you miss Greased Lightning there behind you?,black_panther
T'challa,Six. Just spotted an old friend who works for the CIA. It just got a little more complicated. Agent Ross.,black_panther
everett ross,Your Highness.,black_panther
T'challa,You are buying from Klaue.,black_panther
everett ross,"What I’m doing or not doing… on behalf of the U.S. government is none of your concern. Now, whatever the hell you’re up to… do me a favor, stay out of my way.",black_panther
T'challa,I gave you Zemo.,black_panther
everett ross,"Didn’t I keep it under wraps… that the king of a third world country runs around in a bulletproof cat suit? I’d say we were even. You really need to leave, now.",black_panther

croupier,"Three, craps.",black_panther

everett ross,"Mmm-hmm. Okay, heads up. The king of Wakanda is here. He cannot leave with Klaue. (WALKS TO T'CHALLA) All right. Vibranium from the Attack on Sokovia links back to a person… that I’m not actually saying I’m here to make a deal with… but that deal will not be called off. When the dust settles, you and me can work something out.",black_panther
T'challa,I’m not here to make a deal.,black_panther

t’challa,"My name is King T’Challa… son of King T’Chaka. I am the sovereign ruler of the nation of Wakanda. And for the first time in our history… we will be sharing our knowledge and resources… with the outside world. Wakanda will no longer watch from the shadows. We cannot. We must not. We will work to be an example of how we… as brothers and sisters on this earth… should treat each other. Now, more than ever… the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth. More connects us than separates us. But in times of crisis… the wise build bridges… while the foolish build barriers. We must find a way… to look after one another… as if we were one, single tribe.",black_panther

the broker,"A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty, who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture, is wiped from existence! [the Brokers starts pushing Peter again] ",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Woh. Come on! ,guardians_galaxy
the broker,He’s someone whose bad side I’d rather not be on. ,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,What? What about my bad side? [the Broker opens his shop door and pushes Peter out] ,guardians_galaxy
the broker,"Farewell, Mr. Quill. [he closes the door in Peter’s face] ",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"[shouting to the Broker through his closed shop door] Hey, we had a deal, bro! [as he steps back he notices Gamora standing nearby watching him] ",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,What happened? ,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Uh...this guy just backed out of a deal on me. If there's one thing I hate, it's a man without integrity. Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord. ",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,You have the bearing of a man of honor. [Peter starts to playfully throw the orb up and down in his hand] ,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Well, you know, I wouldn't say that. People say it about me, all the time, but it's not something I would ever say about myself. [suddenly Gamora grabs the orb, kicks Peter in his stomach and runs off, Peter throws something like a magnetic rope which catches around Gamora's legs and trips her up, as she gets the rope off her legs Peter catches up to her but Gamora manages to kick him off and starts punching him, she holds up her knife ready to stab him] ",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"This wasn't the plan. [as she's about to stab Peter, Rocket jumps on to her and knocks her down; to Groot referring to Peter] ",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag! [Groot extends his roots and goes to grab Gamora] No! Not her, him! Learn genders, man. [as he struggles with Gamora she tries to bite him] Biting? That's not fair! [as Rocket is fighting with Gamora, Peter uses this opportunity to grab the orb and runs off] [as Rocket struggles to hold Gamora] Take it easy! [Gamora manages to free herself from Rocket and Groot's clutches, she throws Rockets aside, picks up a piece of metal, throws it at Peter's hand making him drop the orb, she grabs and as she runs off Peter jumps on to her and knocks her down but Gamora overpowers him again and hold Peter down] ",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Fool. You should have learned. ,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"I don't learn. One of my issues. [Peter grabs the orb from her hand, attaches small rocket launcher on Gamora and sets it off throwing Gamora aside, thinking he's in the clear suddenly Groot places a bag over Peter's head] What the... [Groot starts carrying Peter in the bag over his shoulder] ",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Quit smiling, you idiot. You're supposed to be a professional. [just then he sees Gamora coming towards them] You gotta be kidding me. [she pushes Rocket aside] Hey! [Gamora fights with Groot, cutting off his arms, as she opens the bag Peter suddenly uses his gun to electrocute her and runs off, Rocket gets out his gun and aims it at Peter] I live for the simple things. Like how much this is gonna hurt. [he shoots his gun which shoots a ball of electricity at Peter giving him an electric shock] Yeah. Writhe, little man. [he looks at Groot who is looking sadly as his severed arms] It'll grow back, you D'ast idiot. Quit whining. [just then they are captured by The Nova Corps] ",guardians_galaxy
nova arresting pilot,"Subject 89P13, drop your weapon. ",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Oh, crap. [Rockets reluctantly drops his weapon] ",guardians_galaxy
nova arresting pilot,"By the authority of the Nova Corps, you are under arrest... [at the same time Peter is being arrested] ",guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,Alright. Come on up. ,guardians_galaxy
nova arresting pilot,...for endangerment to life and the destruction of property. [as Dey arrests Peter he recognizes him] ,guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince. ,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Star-Lord. ,guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,"Oh, sorry. Lord. [to his partner] I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft. He's got a code name. ",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Come on, man. It's a...it's an outlaw name. ",guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,"Just relax, pal. It's cool to have a code name. It's not that weird. [referring to the Nova Corps] ",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Fascists. [we see as Rocket, Groot and an unconscious Gamora are arrested]",guardians_galaxy
nova prime,Ronan is destroying Xandarian outposts throughout the galaxy. I should think that would call for some slight response on the part of the Kree. ,guardians_galaxy
kree ambassador,"We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime. What more do you want? ",guardians_galaxy
nova prime,"At least a statement from the Kree Empire saying that they condemn his actions. He is slaughtering children, families. ",guardians_galaxy
kree ambassador,"That is your business. Now, I have other matters to attend to. [he ends the call] ",guardians_galaxy
nova prime,Prick. ,guardians_galaxy
denarian saal,"Well, some good news. Looks like we’ve apprehended one of Ronan’s compatriots. [after all four have been captured and taken to Nova Headquarters, Dey presents each of them to Saal] ",guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,"Gamora. Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon. The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan, Thanos. Recently, Thanos lent her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan, which leads us to believe that Thanos and Ronan are working together. [next it’s Rocket] Subject 89P13. Calls itself Rocket. The result of illegal genetic and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form. [referring to Groot] ",guardians_galaxy
denarian saal,What the hell? ,guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,"They call it Groot. A humanoid plant that’s been traveling recently as 89P13’s personal house plant slash muscle. [next up is Peter] Peter Jason Quill, from Terra. Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers, led by Yondu Udonta. ",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"[Quill winds up his middle finger and flips the bird at them] Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know how this machine worked. ",guardians_galaxy
denarian saal,What a bunch of a-holes. [Dey smiles] Transport all four to the Kyln.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws, but these ones here, they're corrupt and cruel. But, hey, that's not my problem. I ain't gonna be here long. I've escaped 22 prisons, this one's no different. You're lucky the broad showed up, because otherwise, me and Groot would be collecting that bounty right now, and you'd be getting drawn and quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers. ",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,I've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years. I ain't about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon. ,guardians_galaxy
prison guard,Hold. ,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,What's a raccoon? ,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"""What's a raccoon?"" It's what you are, stupid. ",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Ain't no thing like me, except me. [as they are being led to their cell] ",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"So, this orb has a real shiny blue suitcase, Ark of the Covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe. What is it? ",guardians_galaxy
groot,I am Groot. ,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,So what? What's the Orb? ,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,I have no words for an honorless thief. ,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac. [Gamora looks at Rocket] Yeah, I know who you are. Anyone who's anyone knows who you are. ",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"I am Groot.) Yeah, you said that. ",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"I wasn't retrieving the orb for Ronan, I was betraying him. I had an agreement to sell it to a third party. ",guardians_galaxy
groot,I am Groot. ,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Well, that’s just as fascinating as the first 89 times you told that. What is wrong with Giving Tree, here? ",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Well, he don’t know talking good like me and you. So his vocabulistics is limited to “I” and “am” and “Groot”. Exclusively in that order. ",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"I tell you what, that’s gonna wear real thin, real fast.",guardians_galaxy
Drax,Cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one.",guardians_galaxy
Drax,Do not ever call me a thesaurus.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"It's just a metaphor, dude.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"His people are completely literal, metaphors are gonna go over his head.",guardians_galaxy
Drax,Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy. [as the prison guards surround the watchtower carrying large weapons],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Those are some big guns.,guardians_galaxy
head riot guard,[to the guards] On my command! Number one! [one of the guards shoots his weapon which hits one of the watchtower glass windows],guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Rodent, we are ready for your plan.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Hold on!,guardians_galaxy
head riot guard,Number two! [another guard shoots his weapon which hits the other side of the watchtower; referring to Rocket],guardians_galaxy
Drax,I recognize this animal. We'd roast them over a flame pit as children. Their flesh was quite delicious.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Not helping!,guardians_galaxy
head riot guard,[to the guards] Number three! [another shoots their weapon which hits another glass window of the watchtower leaving a massive crack] All fire on my command! [Rocket works as fast as he can to save them] Three! Two! One! [just then Rocket rigs to turn off the gravity making everyone in the prison start floating],guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"You turned off the artificial gravity, everywhere but in here.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"I told you I had a plan. [Rocket disconnects the watchtower from its base, then uses the security droids to attack to the base of it and uses the droids jets to fly the watchtower out of the prison]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"That was a pretty good plan. [they get out of the watchtower, the others go grab their personal stuff and Peter looks for his spaceship] Yeah! There it is. Get my ship. It's the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"They crumpled my pants up into a ball. That's rude! They folded yours. [Peter then gets his personal stuff and looks through it, we see the orb on one of his bags]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,The orb's there. Let's go!,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Wait, wait, wait. [Peter keeps searching for his Walkman in his stuff]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,What?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,That bastard didn't put it back.,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Put what back? [Peter gives the bag containing the orb to Gamora],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Here. Get them to the ship, I will be right back.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,How are you gonna possibly...,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Just keep the Milano close by. Go. Go! [Peter runs off] [Peter attacks the prison guards using his weapon taking each one down one by one],guardians_galaxy
prison guard,"Ow! My neck! [Peter shoots him again as he walks past him, at the same time the others have boarded the Milano and are waiting for Peter]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Well, how's he gonna get to us?",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,He declined to share that information with me.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Well, screw this, then! I ain't waiting around for some humie with a death wish. You got the orb, right?",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Yes. [Gamora looks in the bag that Peter gave her and finds the orb is missing, we see Peter has kept the orb and is throwing it up and down in his hand as he goes to get his Walkman from the guard that took it, he uses the orb to bash the guard over the head; back on the Milano]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"If we don't leave now, we will be blown to bits.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,No! We're not leaving without the orb. [just then Drax notices Peter flying towards them],guardians_galaxy
Drax,"Behold. [as they help Peter board onto the Milano] This one shows spirit. He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan. [to Peter] Companion, what were you retrieving? [Peter gives him the Walkman] You're an imbecile. [as they are flying off in the Milano, Peter finds Rocket taking apart parts of the ship]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Woh, woh, woh! Yoh, Ranger Rick! What are you doing? You can't take apart my ship without asking me! See, what is this?",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Don't touch that, it's a bomb.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,A bomb?,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Yep.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,And you leave it lying around?,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,I was gonna put it in a box.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,What's a box gonna do? [Rocket pulls out a box and takes out the wrapped present Peter's mother had given him before she had died],guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,How about this one?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,No! Woh! Hey! Hey! Leave it alone!,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Why? What is it?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Shut up.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Hey! [pointing to something else Rocket had pulled out of the ship],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,What is that?,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,That's for if things get really hardcore. Or if you wanna blow up moons.,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,No one's blowing up moons.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"So, listen, I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"We're heading in the right direction, for now. [Gamora picks up the orb]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"If we're gonna work together, you might want to try trusting me a little bit.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,And how much do you trust me? [he takes the orb out of Gamora's hand],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,I'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was. Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon.,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,I don't know what it is. [Peter places the orb on the table and Drax picks it up],guardians_galaxy
Drax,"If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Put it down, you fool! You'll destroy us all.",guardians_galaxy
Drax,"Or just you, murderess!",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"I let you live once, princess!",guardians_galaxy
Drax,I am not a princess!,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Hey! Nobody is killing anybody on my ship! We're stuck together until we get the money. [Drax throws the orb to Peter],guardians_galaxy
Drax,"If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Put it down, you fool! You'll destroy us all.",guardians_galaxy
Drax,"Or just you, murderess!",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"I let you live once, princess!",guardians_galaxy
Drax,I am not a princess!,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Hey! Nobody is killing anybody on my ship! We're stuck together until we get the money. [Drax throws the orb to Peter],guardians_galaxy
Drax,I have no interest in money. [Drax walks off],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Great. That means more money for the three of us. [Groot makes a noise indicating he counts too] For the four of us. Partners.,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"We have an agreement, but I would never be partners with the likes of you. I'll tell the buyer we're on our way. And Quill, your ship is filthy. [she turns and walks up the stairs]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Oh, she has no idea. If I had a black light, the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"You got issues, Quill. [Ronan and Nebula are at the The Kyln torturing one of the prison guards]",guardians_galaxy
head riot guard,"I swear, I don't know where they went! I swear!",guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"If he knew where they were headed, he'd have already told us.",guardians_galaxy
head riot guard,Yeah.,guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison. Well, then, send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant. Find the orb. Any means, any price.",guardians_galaxy
Nebula,And this place?,guardians_galaxy
ronan,The Nova can't know what we're after. Cleanse it! [Yondu pays a visit to the Broker to find out what Peter has done with the orb],guardians_galaxy
Yondu,Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one? I like to stick 'em all in a row on my control console.,guardians_galaxy
the broker,I can't tell if you're joking or not.,guardians_galaxy
kraglin,He's being fully serious.,guardians_galaxy
the broker,"In that case, I can show you... [Yondu laughs]",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"But first, you gonna tell me what this orb is, and why everybody cares so damn much about it. And then you gonna tell me, who out there might wanna buy it.",guardians_galaxy
the broker,"Sir, the high-end community is a... [Yondu interrupts and mocks him by speaking gibberish] The high-end community is a... [Yondu continues to talk gibberish over the Broker] It's a tight-knit... [Yondu interrupts him again with more gibberish] Tight-knit... [Yondu interrupts him again] The high-end community is a very tight-knit... [Yondu interrupts him again talking gibberish making Kraglin laugh] I cannot possibly betray the confidentiality of my buyers! [Yondu threatens him by making his arrow float and hover towards the Broker's face]",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"Now, who again is this buyer of yours? [on the Collector's ship]",guardians_galaxy
the collector,Carina.,guardians_galaxy
carina,"Yes, Master.",guardians_galaxy
the collector,"Your people do have elbows, do they not?",guardians_galaxy
carina,"We do, Master.",guardians_galaxy
the collector,"Then use them. I don't have to remind you what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me. Do I? [Carina fearfully looks at the previous servant who is now locked up in one of the glass cells on the Collector's ship] Chop, chop. Our guests will be here soon. [Carina quickly goes back to cleaning the glass cells] [back on the Milano]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Heads up! We're inbound. [they all watch as they head towards Knowhere which looks like a giant severed-head],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Woh.,guardians_galaxy
Drax,What is it?,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"It's called Knowhere. The severed head of an ancient celestial being. Be wary headed in, rodent. There are no regulations whatsoever here. [we see the Milano enter Knowhere, Mining Colony] Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in to mine the organic matter within the skull. The bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid. All rare resources, highly valued in black markets across the galaxy. It's dangerous and illegal work, suitable only for outlaws. [we see the group walking around in the streets of Knowhere]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Well, I come from a planet of outlaws. Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde and John Stamos.",guardians_galaxy
Drax,It sounds like a place which I would like to visit.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Yeah, you should. [a bunch of kids surround them]",guardians_galaxy
knowhere kid,Excuse me.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,[to the others] Watch your wallets.,guardians_galaxy
knowhere kid,Can you spare any units?,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Get out of here. [a girl walks up to Groot, he grows a flower in his hand, plucks it and gives it to her before walking off] [as they walk towards a bar] Your buyer's in there?",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,We are to wait here for his representative. [we see a bouncer throws a patron out of the bar],guardians_galaxy
bar bouncer,Get out of here!,guardians_galaxy
Drax,"This is no respectable establishment. What do you expect us to do while we wait? [while they wait for their appointment, Drax, Rocket and Groot get drunk and gamble] Yes! Yes!",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Yahoo!,guardians_galaxy
Drax,"My Orloni has won, as I win at all things! Now, let's put more of this liquid into our bodies.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,That's the first thing you said that wasn't bat-shit crazy! [at the same time Peter and Gamora are on the balcony of the bar],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Man, you wouldn't believe what they charge for fuel out here. I might actually lose money on this job.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,My connection is making us wait.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"It's just a negotiation tactic. Trust me, this is my specialty. Where yours is more, ""Stab, stab. Those are my terms."" [Gamora smiles]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,My father didn't stress diplomacy.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Thanos?,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"He's not my father. When Thanos took my home world, he killed my parents in front of me. He tortured me, turned me into a weapon. When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for Ronan, I...I couldn't stand by and... [she notices Peter's Walkman on his belt and takes it] Why would you risk your life for this?",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"My mother gave it to me. My mom liked to share with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up. I happened to have it on me when I was...the day that she... You know, when I left Earth. [Peter takes the Walkman from Gamora and puts it back on his belt]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,What do you do with it?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Do? Nothing. You listen to it. Or you can dance.,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,I'm a warrior and an assassin. I do not dance.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Really? Well, on my planet, there's a legend about people like you. It's called ""Footloose."" And in it, a great hero named Kevin Bacon, teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing, well...it's the greatest thing there is.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Who put the sticks up their butts?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"What? No, that's just a...",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,That is cruel.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"It's just a phrase people use. [Peter puts the Walkman headphones onto Gamora's head so she can listen to the music, after listening for a moment she speaks out loud]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,The melody is pleasant! [as Gamora listens to the music Peter's leans in to kiss her when suddenly Gamora puts a knife to his throat] No!,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Ow! What the hell?,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"I know who you are, Peter Quill! And I am not some starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your...your pelvic sorcery!",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"That is not what is happening here. [as Gamora lets go of his throat Peter notices Drax, Rocket and Groot are all fighting inside the bar] Oh, no. [Peter and Gamora enter the bar to stop the fight between Drax, Rocket and Groot, Gamora drags Drax off of Groot]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Stop it! [Rocket points his weapon at Drax as he's about to shoot Peter intervenes],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Woh! Woh! What are you doing?,guardians_galaxy
Drax,This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,That is true!,guardians_galaxy
Drax,He has no respect!,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,That is also true!,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Hold on! Hold on!,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Keep calling me vermin, tough guy! You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Rocket, you're drunk. Alright? No one's laughing at you.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"He thinks I'm some stupid thing! He does! Well, I didn't ask to get made! I didn't ask to be torn apart, and put back together, over and over and turned into some...some little monster!",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,He called me vermin! She called me rodent! Let's see if you can laugh after five or six good shots to your frickin' face! [as Rocket points his weapon at Drax again Peter stands in front of him],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"No, no, no, no! Four billion units! Rocket! Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one more lousy night and you're rich. [Rocket hesitates for a moment then lowers his weapon]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Fine. But I can't promise when all this is over I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"See? That's exactly why none of you have any friends! Five seconds after you meet somebody, you're already trying to kill them!",guardians_galaxy
Drax,"We have traveled halfway across the quadrant, and Ronan is no closer to being dead. [Drax turns and leaves in anger]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Drax!,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Let him go. We don't need him. [just then the Collector's assistant, Carina, enters the bar]",guardians_galaxy
carina,"Milady Gamora, I'm here to fetch you for my master. [Carina escorts them to the Collector's home]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Okay, this isn't creepy at all.",guardians_galaxy
carina,"We house the galaxy's largest collection of fauna, relics, and species of all manner. [she takes them to the Collectors massive room of collections where he's waiting for them] I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, the Collector. [Gamora and the Collector walk towards each other]",guardians_galaxy
the collector,"Oh, my dear Gamora. How wonderful to meet in the flesh. [he kisses her hand]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan. We have what we discussed. [as the Collector notices Groot]",guardians_galaxy
the collector,What is that thing there?,guardians_galaxy
groot,I am Groot. [the Collector goes over to Groot],guardians_galaxy
the collector,"I never thought I'd meet a Groot. Sir, you must allow me to pay you now so that I may own your carcass. At the moment of your death, of course.",guardians_galaxy
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Why, so he could turn you into a frickin' chair?",guardians_galaxy
the collector,[to Groot] That's your pet?,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"His what?! [Rocket goes to grab his weapon and the Collector chuckles, Gamora intervenes]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Tivan, we have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this orb.",guardians_galaxy
the collector,"Very well, then. Let us see what you brought. [Gamora looks at Peter, he retrieves the orb from his bag but accidentally drops it, he quickly picks it up to show the Collector] [meanwhile a drunken Drax notices a man making a call in a booth]",guardians_galaxy
knowhere civilian,"Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of cotati seeds. No, cases. Last time, you sent me... [suddenly Drax comes up from behind and holds a knife against his throat]",guardians_galaxy
Drax,You shall send a message for me. [back with the Collector and the group],guardians_galaxy
the collector,"Oh, my new friends. Before creation itself, there were six singularities. [he uses a device to unlock and open the orb] Then the universe exploded into existence, and the remnants of these systems were forged into concentrated ingots. Infinity Stones. These stones, it seems, can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary strength. Observe. [he shows them the giant beings that use the Infinity Stones as weapons] These carriers can use the stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,There's a little pee coming out of me right now.,guardians_galaxy
the collector,"Once, for a moment, a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves, but even they were quickly destroyed by it. [the orb is opened to reveal an Infinity Stone] Beautiful. Beyond compare.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Blah, blah, blah. We're all very fascinated, whitey. But we'd like to get paid.",guardians_galaxy
the collector,How would you like to get paid?,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"What do you think, fancy man? Units!",guardians_galaxy
the collector,"Very well, then. [as the Collector goes to get the money, Carina, fascinated by the Infinity Stone, walks towards it] Carina. Stand back.",guardians_galaxy
carina,I will no longer be your slave!,guardians_galaxy
the collector,"No! [Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that destroys herself as well the Collectors archive, Groot grabs Rocket and runs out of the place as it explodes; Peter and Gamora come out from under the table to look at the destruction caused by the explosion]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,What the fff...? [Gamora grabs the orb and locks it back up to contain the Infinity Stone as they leave the Collector's place],guardians_galaxy
Gamora,How could I think Tivan could contain whatever was within the orb?,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,What do you still have it for?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Well what are we gonna do, leave it in there?",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,I can't believe you had that in your purse!,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,We have to bring this to the Nova Corps. There's a chance they can contain it.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Are you kidding me? We're wanted by the Nova Corps! Just give it to Ronan!,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,So he can destroy the galaxy?,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"What are you, some Saint all of a sudden? What has the galaxy ever done for you? Why would you wanna save it?",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow the stone to fall into Ronan's hands. We have to go back to your ship and deliver it to Nova.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Right, right, okay. I think you're right. Or we could give it to somebody who's not going to arrest us, who's really nice for a whole lot of money. I think it's a really good balance between both of your points of view.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,You're despicable.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,I...,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Dishonorable. Faithless! [Gamora turns and starts to walk off when she notices Ronan and his crew arriving in their ships] Oh, no.",guardians_galaxy
Drax,At last! I shall meet my foe and destroy him.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,You called Ronan? [just as Ronan's ships are landing Yondu and his men turn up too],guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"Quill! Don't you move, boy! [Peter and Gamora make a run for it] Don't you move! Get out of the way! [Yondu chases after them, at the same time Ronan steps off his ship and Drax waits for him with his knives raised]",guardians_galaxy
Drax,Ronan the Accuser!,guardians_galaxy
ronan,You are the one who transmitted the message?,guardians_galaxy
Drax,"You killed my wife. You killed my daughter! [Gamora, Rocket and Peter find the little mining pods and go to board three of them; to Groot]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"I told you, you can't fit. Now, wait here. I'll be back. [Nebula notices the three mining pods taking off]",guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"It is Gamora. She is escaping with the orb. [Nebula goes back to board their ship, Ronan turns to join her]",guardians_galaxy
Drax,No! [Drax runs towards Ronan he goes to strike him with his knife when Ronan easily dodges it],guardians_galaxy
ronan,"Nebula, retrieve the orb. [as Nebula takes off on the ship, Ronan stays behind to fight with Drax] [as Nebula is chasing after the three mining pods containing Rocket, Peter and Gamora]",guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"The stone is in the furthest pod. Bring it down! [Nebula chases Gamora's ship, at the same time Drax continues his battle with Ronan; as Nebula chases after Gamora Peter takes his pod over to Rocket's]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,How? We've got no weaponry on these things.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"These pods are industrial grade, they're nearly indestructible.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Not against necroblasts, they're not.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,That's not what I'm saying.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Oh! [Rocket takes his pod over to the two ships chasing them, he crashes into each one destroying them both, then as another one comes over to shoot at his pod, Rocket flies straight into it making it explode, Peter then hijacks one of the ships chasing them]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Let me borrow your ride. [Ronan and Drax continue their battle with Ronan beating Drax and holding him down by his throat],guardians_galaxy
ronan,"I don't recall killing your family. I doubt I'll remember killing you, either. [at the same time Nebula and her crew continue chasing after Gamora]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Quill, I'm trapped! I can't make it to the Milano, I have to head out.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,What? Wait! These things aren't meant to go out there. [Gamora takes her pod above the atmosphere with Nebula chasing after her],guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"You are a disappointment, sister. Of all our siblings, I hated you least.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Nebula, please. If Ronan gets this stone he'll kill us all.",guardians_galaxy
Nebula,Not all. You will already be dead. [Nebula blows up Gamora's ship leaving Gamora floating in space and taking the Infinity Stone] [we see Ronan dragging and unconscious Drax on the ground and then throwing him into a tub of yellow liquid],guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"Ronan, it is done. [at the same time Peter and Rocket watch Gamora's body as it floats in the atmosphere]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Quill, come on. Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes, but there's nothing we can do for her. These pods aren't meant to be out here. In a second, we're gonna be in the same boat. [Rocket turns his pod and starts leaving]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Aw, damn it!",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Quill? [Peter reluctantly places a call],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Yondu! Yondu! This is Quill! My coordinates are two-two-seven-K-three-two- four.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Quill? Quill, what are you doing?",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Just outside Knowhere. If you're there, come get me. I'm all yours. [Peter then puts on his mask, exits the pod and goes over to Gamora]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Quill, don't be ridiculous. Get back into your pod! You can't fit two people in there, you're gonna die. [Peter hold Gamora's body and starts to take off his mask] You'll die in seconds! Quill! [Peter puts his mask onto Gamora's head and she starts to breath, then Yondu's ship arrive and takes Peter and Gamora before they die] [as they enter Yondu's ship Gamora becomes conscious whilst Peter is still holding her]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Quill? What happened?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"I saw you out there. I don't know what came over me, but I couldn't let you die. I found something inside of myself. Something incredibly heroic. I mean, not to brag, but objectively... [Gamora sighs with frustration]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Where's the orb?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"It's...well, they got the orb.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,What? [just then a door opens and Yondu's men enter],guardians_galaxy
kraglin,"Welcome home, Peter. [Groot saves Drax out of the yellow liquid and helps him to breath, Rocket then lands his pod right in front of them and gets out]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Blasted idiot. They're all idiots! Quill just got himself captured! [to Drax] None of this ever would have happened if you didn't try to single-handedly take on a frickin' army!,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Oh, boo-hoo-hoo. ""My wife and child are dead."" [Groot gasps in shock at Rocket's callousness] Oh, I don't care if it's mean! Everybody's got dead people! That's no excuse to get everybody else dead along the way! Come on, Groot. Ronan has the stone. The only chance we got is to get to the other side of the universe as fast as we can and maybe, just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives before that whack-job ever gets there. [Groot rises to his feet in defiance]",guardians_galaxy
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Save them? How?,guardians_galaxy
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"I know they're the only friends that we ever had, but there's an army of Ravagers around them. And there's only two of us! [Drax rises and stands next to Groot]",guardians_galaxy
Drax,"Three. [Rocket grunts in anger and frustration, turns and starts kicking the ground with his feet]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Aw! You're making me beat up grass! [back on board the Dark Astor Ronan contacts Thanos],guardians_galaxy
ronan,"The orb is in my possession, as I promised. [Korath holds up the orb in his hand]",guardians_galaxy
thanos,Bring it to me.,guardians_galaxy
ronan,"Yes, that was our agreement. [Ronan takes the orb from Korath] Bring you the orb, and you will destroy Xandar for me. However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone, I wonder what use I have for you.",guardians_galaxy
thanos,"Boy, I would reconsider your current course. [Ronan opens up the orb and looks at the Infinity Stone inside]",guardians_galaxy
korath,Master! You cannot! Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.,guardians_galaxy
ronan,"Not anymore. [suddenly Ronan embeds the Infinity Stone in his warhammer and absorbs its power into his body] You call me ""boy!"" I will unfurl one thousand years of Kree justice on Xandar, and burn it to its core! Then, Thanos, I'm coming for you. [he ends his call to Thanos]",guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"After Xandar, you're going to kill my father?",guardians_galaxy
ronan,You dare to oppose me?,guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"You see what he has turned me into. You kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets. [on Yondu's ship, Yondu is beating Peter who's being held by Yondu's men]",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,You betrayed me! Steal my money!,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Stop it! Leave him alone!,guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"When I picked you up as a kid, these boys wanted to eat you. They ain't never tasted Terran before. I saved your life!",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Oh, will you shut up about that? God! Twenty years, you've been throwing that in my face, like it's some great thing, not eating me! Normal people don't even think about eating someone else! Much less that person having to be grateful for it! You abducted me, man. You stole me from my home and from my family.",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"You don't give a damn about your Terra! You're scared because you're soft, in here. [he beats his chest] Here! Right here! [Yondu grabs Peter again to hit him]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Yondu! Listen to me! Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.,guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"I know what he's got, girl.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Then you know we must get it back! He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar. We have to warn them. Billions of people will perish.,guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"[to Peter, referring to Gamora] Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy? Sentiment? [he slaps Peter and his men laugh] Eating away your brain like maggots! That's it. [he whistles commanding his weapon fly over to point at Peter's throat]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,No!,guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"Sorry, boy. But a captain's gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him.",guardians_galaxy
kraglin,Captain's gotta teach stuff! [the others grunt in agreement],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"If you kill me now, you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen. [Yondu smiles and turns to face Peter]",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,The Stone? I hope you got something better than that. Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,We got a ringer.,guardians_galaxy
Yondu,Is that right?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"She knows everything there is to know about Ronan. His ships, his army.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,He's vulnerable.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Hey, what do you say, Yondu, huh? Me and you, taking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days. [Yondu hesitates as he thinks for a moment, then he whistles and his weapon moves from Peter's throat] [Yondu and his men start to laugh and Peter joins in]",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"Let him go! Oh! You always did have a scrote, boy! That's why I kept you on as a young'un. [just then the ship shakes as it gets hit by something]",guardians_galaxy
ravager pilot,"Captain, the shot was non-damaging. [we see the Milano approaching Yondu's ship]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Attention, idiots. The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer. [we see Drax in a space suit standing on top of the Milano holding a weapon] It's a weapon of my own design.",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,What the hell?,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"If you don't hand over our companions now, he's gonna tear your ship a new one. A very big new one!",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,I ain't buyin' it.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"I'm giving you to the count of five. Five, four, three... [Peter and Gamora stop Kraglin from giving the order to blow up the Milano]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,No!,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"No, no! Don't!",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"No! Wait, hold on! [Peter quickly turns on the radio comm] Rocket, it's me, for God sakes! We figured it out! We're fine!",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Oh, hey, Quill. What's going on? [on board the Milano after Peter's explained his plan to the group] You call that ""figured it out""? We're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Oh, you want to talk about senseless? How about trying to save us by blowing us up?",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,We were only gonna blow you up if they didn't turn you over!,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,And how on earth were they gonna turn us over when you only gave them a count of five?,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Well we didn't have time to work out the minutiae of the plan. This is what we get for acting altruistically!,guardians_galaxy
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,They are ungrateful.,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,What's important now is we get the Ravagers' army to help us save Xandar.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,We'll figure that part out later.,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,We have to stop Ronan.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,How?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,I have a plan.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,You've got a plan?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Yes.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"First of all, you're copying me from when I said I had a plan.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"No, I'm not. People say that all the time, it's not that unique of a thing to say.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,I have part of a plan!,guardians_galaxy
Drax,What percentage of a plan do you have?,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,You don't get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.,guardians_galaxy
Drax,I just saved Quill.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,We've already established that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me.,guardians_galaxy
Drax,When did we establish it?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Like three seconds ago!,guardians_galaxy
Drax,"I wasn't listening, I was thinking of something else.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,[in frustration] Oh!,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"She's right, you don't get an opinion. [to Peter] What percentage?",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"I don't know, twelve percent.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Twelve percent? [Rocket laughs out loud],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,That's a fake laugh.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,It's real!,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Totally fake.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"That is the most real, authentic, hysterical laugh of my entire life because that is not a plan.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,It's barely a concept.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,You're taking their side?,guardians_galaxy
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"So what, it's better than eleven percent? What the hell does that have to do with anything?",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Thank you, Groot. Thank you. See? Groot's the only one of you who has a clue. [Peter turns to see Groot starting to chew on a leaf protruding from his shoulder, Peter shakes his head and Rocket chuckles] Guys. Come on. Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds. He expects to hear this big plan of ours. I need your help. I look around at us, you know what I see? Losers. I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff. And we have. Man, we have. All of us. Our homes, our families, normal lives. And, usually, life takes more than it gives, but not today. Today, it's given us something. It has given us a chance.",guardians_galaxy
Drax,To do what?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"To give a shit. For once, not run away. I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"But, Quill, stopping Ronan, it's impossible. You're asking us to die.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Yeah, I guess I am. I... [Peter turns his back to the group in defeat]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Quill. I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies. [Gamora rises to her feet] I will be grateful to die among my friends. [Drax rises to his feet],guardians_galaxy
Drax,"You are an honorable man, Quill. I will fight beside you. And in the end, see my wife and daughter again. [Groot rises next]",guardians_galaxy
groot,"I am Groot. [they all then look at Rocket, who finally sighs and gives in]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Oh, what the hell. I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway. [Rocket also rises and stands on his seat] Now I'm standing. You all happy? We're all standing up now. Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle. [as they start to plan to take back the stone from Ronan]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"The stone reacts to anything organic. The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"All Ronan's gotta do is touch the stone to the planet's surface and zap. All plants, animals, Nova Corps.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Everything will die.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"So Ronan does not make the surface. Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole in the Dark Aster's starboard hull. Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.",guardians_galaxy
kraglin,Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?,guardians_galaxy
Drax,"I think of Sakaaran as paper people. [Kraglin smiles and gives Drax a friendly punch on the shoulder, but Drax, not understanding the playful jester, gives Kraglin a look like he's going to hit him]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Once they know we're on board, Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck. Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"We'll make it to the flight deck, and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the stone. Use these devices to contain it. [the devices are passed out] If you touch it, it will kill you.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"I'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us. Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help. [we see Peter contacting Dey]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,There's one more thing we need to complete the plan. [he points to one of Yondu's men who has one robotic eye] That guy's eye...,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"No! No, we don't. No, we don't need that guy's eye.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"No, seriously, I need it! It's important to me.",guardians_galaxy
ravager navigator,"Ronan's fleet has been spotted, and will arrive in t-minus fifteen minutes.",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"[to Peter] Remember, boy. At the end of all this, I get the stone. You cross me, we kill you all. [after getting ready, Peter and the rest the group start walking along the ship] Let's go get 'em, boys! [Yondu's men leave on their ship; on the Milano]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,This is a terrible plan.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Hey, you're the one who said you wanted to die among friends. [at Nova Headquarters, Dey approaches Nova Prime]",guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,Nova Prime. I received a transmission from one of the Ravagers. He says Ronan's in possession of something called an Infinity Stone and he's headed toward Xandar.,guardians_galaxy
nova prime,Good God.,guardians_galaxy
denarian saal,It's a trick. He's a criminal.,guardians_galaxy
nova prime,Did he say why we should believe him?,guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,"He said his crew just escaped from prison so he'd have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to help. He says that he's an ""a-hole."" But he's not, and I'm quoting him here, ""one hundred percent a dick.""",guardians_galaxy
nova prime,Do you believe him?,guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,"Well, I don't know that I believe anyone's one hundred percent a dick, ma'am.",guardians_galaxy
nova prime,"I mean, do you believe that he's here to help? [Dey hesitates a moment before replying]",guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,Yeah. [on board the Dark Astor; to Ronan],guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"A fleet approaches, they appear to be Ravagers. [the Ravagers fleet of ship stop near the Dark Astor]",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"Fire! [the ships fire at the Dark Astor and the explosion bounces off the ship forming a cloud of fire] Cover it down! Submerge! [the ships, including the Milano duck beneath the wall of fire and go beneath the Dark Astor]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Rocket, hurry! [to the crew on Dark Astor]",guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"All pilots, dive! They're beneath us! [at Nova Headquarters]",guardians_galaxy
nova prime,Evacuate the city. Our priority is to get our people away from the battle. [to her crew as the Ravegers ships and the Milano are firing at the Dark Astor],guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"Forward thrust, now!",guardians_galaxy
kraglin,Come on! [after they've managed to blow a hole in the Dark Astor],guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Quill! Yondu! Now! [Yondu's ship is shot down],guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"Aw, hell! I'm going down, Quill! No more games with me, boy! I'll see you at the end of this! [referring to the fleet of Ronan's ships firing at them]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"There are too many of them, Rocket! We'll never make it up there! [just then they notice Nova Corps ships joining them]",guardians_galaxy
denarian saal,"Peter Quill, this is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps. For the record, I advised against trusting you here.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"They got my ""dick"" message!",guardians_galaxy
denarian saal,Prove me wrong. [with the help of the Nova ships the Peter lands their ship inside the Dark Astor through the whole that was shot through it],guardians_galaxy
Drax,Yes! [Drax laughs as they crash land inside the Dark Astor] Yes!,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,[to Peter] We're just like Kevin Bacon.,guardians_galaxy
Nebula,[to Ronan] The starboard kern has been breached! We have been boarded!,guardians_galaxy
ronan,Continue our approach.,guardians_galaxy
Nebula,But the Nova Corps have engaged!,guardians_galaxy
ronan,None of that will matter once we reach the surface. [turning to the guards],guardians_galaxy
Nebula,Seal security doors! Now! [to the guards as she walks out of Ronan's chambers] Get out of my way! [Rocket looks up from ship at the Dark Astor who is being attacked by the Nova ships],guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Oh, man.",guardians_galaxy
nova prime,"All Nova pilots, interlock and form a blockade. The Dark Aster must not reach the ground. [the Nova ships start to form a giant net]",guardians_galaxy
nova pilot #1,Locked in!,guardians_galaxy
nova pilot #2,Locked in. We're locked in. [Nova ships capture the Dark Astor in their giant net shape form; inside the ship Peter and the rest of the group leave their ship and make their way through the Dark Astor],guardians_galaxy
Drax,I can barely see. [Groot releases glowing particles from his body to light their way] When did you learn to do that?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"I'm pretty sure the answer is ""I am Groot.""",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,The flight deck is three hundred meters this way.,guardians_galaxy
Drax,"I want you all to know that I am grateful for your acceptance after my blunders. It is pleasing to once again have friends. You, Quill, are my friend.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Thanks.,guardians_galaxy
Drax,"This dumb tree, he is my friend.",guardians_galaxy
groot,Mmm.,guardians_galaxy
Drax,"And this green whore, she, too...",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Oh, you must stop! [Nebula intercepts their progress across the Dark Astor]",guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"Gamora, look at what you have done. You have always been weak. You stupid, traitorous... [suddenly Drax a fires a shot at Nebula sending her flying off]",guardians_galaxy
Drax,Nobody talks to my friends like that.,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Head to the flight deck. I'll shut down the power to the security doors. [back down on Xandar after crash landing his ship, Yondu is surrounded by Ronan's army]",guardians_galaxy
maskless sakaaran,"Yondu Udonta. Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps. [Yondu starts whistling which activates his arrow weapon to start floating up] Enough nonsense, Ravager! Time to die... [Yondu whistles again setting of his arrow which kills the entire platoon] [Gamora comes across Nebula as she rises pulling her cracked bones into place]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Nebula, please. [Gamora and Nebula start battling it out as Gamora tries to shut down the power to the security doors]",guardians_galaxy
ronan,"Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots, enact immolation initiative.",guardians_galaxy
nova pilot,"They're dive-bombing the city! Denarian Saal, should we break formation?",guardians_galaxy
denarian saal,No! Hold your positions! [Ronan's ships start attacking Xandar],guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Keep Ronan up there, Saal. We'll take care of the people down here.",guardians_galaxy
denarian saal,I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster. [back on the Dark Astor Peter and the rest of the group are intercepted by Korath and Ronan's crew],guardians_galaxy
korath,Star-lord.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Finally. [they all start battling it out] You thief! [as everyone is battling it out, Korath throws Drax aside]",guardians_galaxy
korath,You will never make it to Ronan. [on Xandar; ordering Yondu's men],guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground. [Rocket and Yondu's men start shooting at Ronan's men in their ships; back on Dark Astor Gamora and Nebula continue to battle it out],guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Come on! [at the same time Peter and the rest of the group continue their battle with Korath and Ronan's crew, Drax manages to grab of hold of Korath and starts taking out part of his head]",guardians_galaxy
Drax,Finger to the throat means death. [he kills Korath and Peter walks over to Drax] Metaphor.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Yeah, sorta. [suddenly more of Ronan's crew come after them] Oh, no. [Groot saves them by skewering a bunch of the goons, then whipping them around to take out the rest, after which he turns to Peter and Drax and smiles] [on the Dark Astor Ronan gives a speech which is heard back at Nova Corps headquarters]",guardians_galaxy
ronan,"Xandar, you stand accused. Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now. It is the tinder on which you burn! [Ronan activates the Infinity Stone which sets off burning a fire through the Dark Astor and destroying the Nova Crops ships that are attacking including Saal's ship]",guardians_galaxy
denarian saal,Rocket!,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Hold on, Saal, just... [Rocket watches as the fire destroys Saal's ship and the other Nova Corps ships] Quill, you gotta hurry. The city's been evacuated, but we're getting our asses kicked down here. [back on the Dark Astor, Peter continues to fight off Ronan's men as he makes his way to the bridge]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Gamora hasn't opened the door! [Gamora and Nebula continue to battle it out, Gamora manages to kick Nebula which throws her off the side of the ship, her arm catches something and she hangs off the edge, Gamora goes to help her]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Nebula! Sister, help us fight Ronan. You know he's crazy!",guardians_galaxy
Nebula,I know you're both crazy. [Nebula cuts off her own hand falls],guardians_galaxy
Gamora,No! [Nebula lands on a Ravager ship and smashes the window],guardians_galaxy
ravager pilot,What the...?,guardians_galaxy
Nebula,"Get out! [she throws the Ravager pilot off the ship] [Gamora opens the bridge's door and she along with Peter, Drax and Groot enter and Peter shoots Ronan with Rocket's super cannon]",guardians_galaxy
Drax,"You did it! [suddenly Ronan rises and uses the power of his warhammer to throw the group aside, Drax rushes towards Ronan but Ronan grabs him by the throat and holds him up]",guardians_galaxy
ronan,"I was mistaken, I do remember your family. Their screams were pitiful. I... [Rocket crashes the Milano into the bridge and seemingly destroys Ronan, the group then huddles together as the ship starts to plummet, Groot forms a giant nest around the group to keep them shielded]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"No, groot! You can't, you'll die. Why are you doing this? Why?",guardians_galaxy
groot,"We are Groot. [the ship then crashes] [everyone in the group has survived the crash except Groot, who is now a pile of twigs strewn all about, Rocket holds a bunch of the twigs in his hand in sadness]",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"I called him an idiot. [just then Ronan emerges from the ship's wreckage, Rocket turns to face him] You killed Groot! [Rocket rushes towards Ronan who uses his warhammer power to throw Rocket aside]",guardians_galaxy
ronan,"Behold! You're Guardians of the Galaxy! What fruit have they wrought? Only that my father and his father shall finally know vengeance. People of Xandar, the time has come to rejoice and renounce your paltry gods! Your salvation is at hand. [as Ronan prepares to use his power to destroy Xandar Peter stands up to and starts singing ""Ooh-ooh Child""]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"""Ooh-oo child, things are gonna get easier. Ooh-oo child, things'll get brighter."" [to Ronan] Listen to these words. [he starts singing again] ""Ooh-oo child, things are gonna get easier. Ooh-oo child, things'll get brighter."" Now bring it down hard! [he starts dancing as he continues to sing] ""Some day, we'll get it together and we'll get it...""",guardians_galaxy
ronan,What are you doing?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Dance-off, bro. Me and you. [as Peter dances he holds his hand out to Gamora] Gamora. [Gamora shakes her head] Subtle. Take it back. [Peter continues to dance]",guardians_galaxy
ronan,What are you doing?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom. [Rocket and Drax appear beside Ronan who use the super cannon to destroy the warhammer which frees the Infinity Stone, both Ronan and Peter go to grab it]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,No! [Peter grabs the stone which then begins to destroy him] Peter! Take my hand! [as Peter turns to Gamora he has flash back to when his mother asked him to take her hand on her death bed],guardians_galaxy
meredith quill,"Take my hand, Peter.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Mom.,guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Take my hand! [with tears in his eyes Peter takes Gamora's hand, Drax then grabs his other hand and Rocket grabs Drax's hand, the power from the stone spread between the four of them]",guardians_galaxy
ronan,You're mortal! How?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"You said it yourself, bitch. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy. [together with the power of the stone they destroy Ronan and Gamora uses the orb to contain the stone] [after destroying Ronan and containing the stone in the orb, Peter turns to look at Gamora, at the same time Yondu and his men show up]",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"Well, well, well. Quite the light show. [he chuckles] Ain't this sweet. But you got some business to attend to before all the nookie-nookie starts.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Peter, you can't. Peter.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"You gotta reconsider this, Yondu. I don't know who you're selling this to, but the only way the universe can survive is if you give it to the Nova Corps.",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"I may be as pretty as an angel, but I sure as hell ain't one. Hand it over, son. [reluctantly Pete gives the orb to Yondu, who laughs and turns to leave with his men]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Yondu. [Yondu faces Peter again] Do not open that orb. You know that, right? You've seen what it does to people. [Yondu chuckles to himself and walks off] [as Yondu and his men take off in their ship they look down and Peter]",guardians_galaxy
kraglin,"Yeah, Quill turned out okay. It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad like we was hired to do.",guardians_galaxy
Yondu,"Yeah, that guy was a jackass. [their ship takes off; to Gamora]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,He's gonna be so pissed when he realizes I switched out the orb on him. [Peter holds the orb containing the stone in his hand and Gamora chuckles],guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"He was gonna kill you, Peter.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Oh, I know. But he was about the only family I had.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,No. He wasn't. [Rocket is sat by Groot's pile of twigs crying when Drax sits next to him and starts stroking his head to comfort him] [Peter and the group are at the Nova Corps headquarters],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Why would you even know this?,guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,"When we arrested you, we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system, so we had it checked out.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,I'm not Terran?,guardians_galaxy
nova prime,"You are half Terran. Your mother was of earth. Your father, well, he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"That could be why you were able to hold the stone for as long as you did. [a door opens, Drax and Rocket have joined them with Rocket holding a pot with a tiny Groot planted in it]",guardians_galaxy
nova prime,"Your friends have arrived. On behalf of the Nova Corps, we'd like to express our profound gratitude for your help in saving Xandar. If you will follow Denarian Dey, he has something to show you.",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Thank you, Nova Prime.",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"Thank you. [as the group follow Dey, Gamora walks next to Drax]",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,Your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them.,guardians_galaxy
Drax,"Yes. Of course, Ronan was only a puppet. It's really Thanos I need to kill. [the group follow Dey outside who takes them to the restored Milano]",guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible. We salvaged as much as we could.,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Wow. I… [Peter looks speechless] Thank you.,guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,"I have a family who are alive because of you. Your criminal records have also been expunged. However, I have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future.",guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"Question. What if I see something that I want to take, and it belongs to someone else?",guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,Well you will be arrested.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,But what if I want it more than the person who has it?,guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,Still illegal.,guardians_galaxy
Rocket Raccoon,"That doesn't follow. No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand? [to Gamora who's laughing] What are you laughing at? Why? I can't have a discussion with this gentleman? [he starts following Gamora towards the Milano]",guardians_galaxy
Drax,What if someone does something irksome and I decide to remove his spine?,guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,"That's...that's actually murder. It's one of the worst crimes of all, so also illegal.",guardians_galaxy
Drax,Hmm. [Drax starts making his way to the Milano],guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"They'll be fine, Dey. I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.",guardians_galaxy
corpsman dey,You?,guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"Yeah, me. [inside the Milano Peter holds the present his mother gave him before she died, he finally opens the letter and reads it]",guardians_galaxy
meredith quill,"[voice over] Peter, I know these last few months have been hard for you. But I'm going to a better place and I will be okay. And I will always be with you. You are the light of my life. My precious son. My little Star-Lord. Love, mom. [Peter opens the present and sees it's another ""Awesome Mix"" tape, he puts the tape into his ship's cassette recorder, presses play and it starts playing ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, Gamora walks over to Peter and they smile at each other; we then see Yondu opening his orb to find inside it is a Troll doll, he smiles to himself; we see Dey returning home to his wife and daughter] [last lines; as Peter and the others prepare to take off, Drax smiles at Rocket who looks at the little Groot plant which starts to wake]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,"So, what should we do next? Something good? Something bad? A bit of both?",guardians_galaxy
Gamora,"We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord. [Peter smiles before replying]",guardians_galaxy
Peter Quill,Bit of both!,guardians_galaxy
Howard Stark,Why do you let it lick you like that for? [we see Howard the Duck sitting in a broken cage holding a glass of drink in his hand] Gross. [he takes a sip from his drink] Yeah! But it burns going down.,guardians_galaxy
Dr. Hank Pym,Stark. ,ant_man
mitchell carson,He doesn’t seem happy. ,ant_man
Howard Stark,"Hello, Hank. You’re supposed to be in Moscow. ",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I took a detour. [he places a vial containing a red serum on the table] Through your defense lab. ,ant_man
peggy carter,Tell me that isn’t what I think it is. ,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"It depends, if you think it’s a poor attempt to replicate my work. Even for this group, that takes nerve. ",ant_man
mitchell carson,"You were instructed to go to Russia. May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you’re a soldier… ",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I’m a scientist. ,ant_man
Howard Stark,"Then act like one. The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed, help us put it to good use. ",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"I let you turn me into your errand boy, and now you try to steal my research? ",ant_man
mitchell carson,"If only you’d protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym. ",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Oh, god. [suddenly Pym slams down Carson’s face on the table in anger, Peggy pulls him away] ",ant_man
peggy carter,"Easy, Hank. ",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,You mention my wife again and I’ll show you ferocity. [Carson looks at Stark as he wipes blood from his nose] ,ant_man
Howard Stark,"Don’t look at me, you said it. ",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I formally tender my resignation. ,ant_man
Howard Stark,"We don’t accept it. Formally. Hank, we need you. The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please, don’t let your past determine the future. ",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"As long as I am alive, nobody will ever get that formula. [Pym turns around and leaves calmly] ",ant_man
mitchell carson,We shouldn’t let him leave the building. ,ant_man
peggy carter,"You’ve already lied to him, now you want to go to war with him? ",ant_man
mitchell carson,Yes! Our scientists haven’t come close to replicating his work. ,ant_man
Howard Stark,"He just kicked your ass full size. You really want to find out what it’s like when you can’t see him coming? I’ve known Hank Pym for a long time, he’s no security risk. Unless we make him one.",ant_man
peachy,You like that? You like that? Come get you some then! [the other prisoners are gathered around them cheering them along] ,ant_man
Scott Lang,You didn’t even move. ,ant_man
peachy,Nah. ,ant_man
Scott Lang,"I mean, what if I come in on the left side, right? Just out here and see this here… [suddenly Scott punches Peachy in the face] ",ant_man
peachy,"I’m gonna miss you, Scott. ",ant_man
Scott Lang,"I’m gonna miss you too, Peachy. [they shake hands] Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals. [Scott says goodbye to the other inmates]",ant_man

Scott Lang,"Oh, we don’t… we don’t make that. ",ant_man
ice cream store customer,"Pretzel. Hot pretzel, like, mustard… in mustard dip? ",ant_man

Scott Lang,Really? ,ant_man
dale,"Yeah, yeah. ",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Oh, thank you, thank you. ",ant_man
dale,"You really stuck it to those billionaire S.O.Bs. And the more I read about what you did and stuff, I’m like, “Wow, I know this guy? I’m in charge of this guy?” Yeesh! ",ant_man

dale,"Yeah, yeah. Well, you’re fired of course. I mean, I can’t really keep you on. ",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Wait, what? Fired? ",ant_man
dale,Yeah. ,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Dale, look, it wasn’t a violent crime, I mean, I’m a good worker. ",ant_man
dale,"No, it wasn’t a violent crime. It was a cool crime. I’ll tell you what, though, this’d be totally off the books, off the records, but, uh… if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door, I’ll just pretend I didn’t see it.",ant_man
Luis,"Hey, Scotty, what’s up? I thought you were supposed to be at work? ",ant_man
Scott Lang,"I was, I got fired. ",ant_man
Luis,Damn! They find out who you are? ,ant_man

dave,Dave. Nice work on the Vista job. ,ant_man
kurt,"Vista job? Yes. No, no, I have heard of this robbery. ",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Well, technically, I didn’t rob them. Robbery involves threat. I hate violence, I burgled them. I’m a cat burglar. ",ant_man
dave,You mean you’re a pussy? ,ant_man
Scott Lang,Yeah. ,ant_man
Luis,"They were overcharging the customers, right? And it added up to millions. He blows the whistle and he gets fired. And what does he do? He hacks into the security system, and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from. ",ant_man
dave,Posts all the bank records online. ,ant_man
Luis,And he drove dude’s Bentley into a swimming pool. ,ant_man
Scott Lang,What are you doing? Hmm? Why are you telling my life’s story to these guys? What do you want? ,ant_man
Luis,"Okay. My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago about this little, perfect job. ",ant_man
Scott Lang,No way. ,ant_man
Luis,"No, no, no. Wait! This guy… this guy fits your M.O. ",ant_man
Scott Lang,No! I’m finished man. I’m not going back to jail. ,ant_man

darren cross,"More like, thrilled.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"I was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you, Darren. What’s the occasion?",ant_man
darren cross,"Oh, you’ll see. Won’t he, Hope?",ant_man
hope van dyne,We’re ready for you inside.,ant_man
darren cross,"Ouch. [referring to Hope] I guess some old wounds never heal, huh? Don’t worry, she’s in good hands. You’re in for a treat.",ant_man
carson,"Long time no see, Dr. Pym. How’s retirement? [they shake hands]",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,How’s your face?,ant_man
hope van dyne,After you.,ant_man
darren cross,"Now before we start I’d like to introduce a very special guest, this company’s founder and my mentor, Dr. Hank Pym. [everyone in the lab claps, at the same time Pym notices the miniature building of Pym Technologies has now got the logo Cross Technologies on it] When I took over this company for Dr. Pym, I immediately started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength. Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank’s research, I couldn’t tell you. But just imagine. A soldier the size of an insect. The ultimate secret weapon. [he shows everyone footage reel of soldiers getting killed but with a tiny costumed figure also every footage] An “Ant-Man”. [pointing to Pym] That’s what they called you. Right, Hank? Silly, I know. Propaganda. Tales to astonish. Trumped up B.S. to scare the U.S.S.R. Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me every single time I asked you, was the Ant-Man real?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Just a tall tale.,ant_man
frank,So it’s a suit.,ant_man
darren cross,"Don’t be crude, Frank. It’s not a suit, it’s a… it’s a vessel. What’s a matter, you’re not impressed?",ant_man
frank,"Oh, I’m impressed. I’m also concerned. Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.",ant_man
darren cross,"We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank. I really value your opinion. Thank you for coming. Hope?",ant_man
hope van dyne,"Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now. Thank you.",ant_man
darren cross,You seem a bit shocked.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Darren, there’s a reason that I buried these secrets.",ant_man
darren cross,"So you finally admit it. We could’ve done this together, Hank. But you ruined that. That’s why you’re the past and I’m the future.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Don’t do this.,ant_man
mitchell carson,"Dr. Cross. [Cross goes over to Carson] You sell to me first, twenty percent of your asking price, I can have the cash here in two weeks.",ant_man
darren cross,Deal.,ant_man

Dr. Hank Pym,How close is he?,ant_man
hope van dyne,He still can’t shrink a live subject. Just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,No.,ant_man
hope van dyne,I have Cross’ complete trust.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,It’s too dangerous.,ant_man
hope van dyne,We don’t have a choice.,ant_man

Scott Lang,"It’s good to see you too, Paxton.",ant_man
cassie lang,"Mommy’s so happy you’re here, she choked on her drink.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Hey, look what I have for you.",ant_man
cassie lang,Can I open it now?,ant_man

hideous rabbit,You’re my bestest friend!,ant_man

paxton,"Yeah, of course sweetheart, go ahead.",ant_man
hideous rabbit,You’re my bestest friend!,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Look, the child support is coming. Alright? It’s just hard finding a job when you have a record.",ant_man
paxton,"I’m sure you’ll figure it out, but for now I want you out of my house.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"No, wait, it’s my daughter’s birthday!",ant_man
paxton,It’s my house!,ant_man
Scott Lang,"So what, it’s my kid!",ant_man
maggie lang,"Scott! You can’t just show up here, you know that. Come on.",ant_man
Scott Lang,It’s her birthday party.,ant_man
maggie lang,"Yeah, I know, but you can’t just show up.",ant_man
Scott Lang,She’s my daughter.,ant_man
paxton,You don’t know the first thing about being a father.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Maggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life, your fiancé is an ass-hat.",ant_man
maggie lang,He’s not an ass-hat.,ant_man
paxton,"Hey, watch your language. Okay?",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Oh, what language. I said hat.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Really, Maggie? That guy? Come on, you could marry anyone you want, you have to get engaged to a cop?",ant_man
maggie lang,At least he’s not a crook.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"I’m trying, okay? I’ve changed, and I’m straight, I had a job, and… I want to provide. I had a lot of time to think about it, and I love her. So much. I’ve missed so much time and I want to be a part of her life. What do I do?",ant_man

frank,"Yeah, well, uh, unfortunately we can’t just do whatever we want. Would be nice though, right?",ant_man
frank,But there are laws.,ant_man

frank,"Darren, I don’t think you understand…",ant_man
darren cross,Hm. We still haven’t worked out all the bugs.,ant_man
darren cross,"Goodbye, Frank.",ant_man
darren cross,"You know I’ve been thinking a lot about gratitude lately, and today during my morning meditation, an interesting thought occurred to me and I think it might apply to you too.",ant_man
hope van dyne,How’s that?,ant_man
darren cross,"Gratitude can be forgiveness. I spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym. I devoted my genius to him. I could’ve worked anywhere. I chose my mentor poorly. You didn’t even have a choice. He never believed in you. It’s a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn’t he? But we shouldn’t be angry, we should be grateful. Because his failures as a mentor, as a father, forced us to spread our wings.",ant_man
hope van dyne,"You’re a success, Darren. You deserve everything coming your way.",ant_man
Luis,"Hey, what’s up, hotshot?",ant_man
dave,Maybe he didn’t hear you.,ant_man
Luis,How was the party?,ant_man
Scott Lang,Tell me about that tip.,ant_man

Scott Lang,I want to know about that tip.,ant_man
Luis,"Ooh, baby, it’s on!",ant_man
dave,Hot dog!,ant_man
Luis,It’s so on right now!,ant_man
dave,Look who grew a pair!,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Calm down, alright? I just need to know where it came from, it’s gotta be airtight.",ant_man
Luis,"Okay. I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto, which was mainly reds, and you know I don’t love reds man, you know? But there was a rosé that saved the day, it was delightful. And he tells me about this girl Emily that we used to kick it with, it was actually the first pair of boobs that I ever touched.",ant_man
Scott Lang,It’s the wrong details. It’s wrong… It has nothing to do with the story. Go!,ant_man
Luis,"“Nah, dog. All she said is that it’s, like, super legit, and whatever’s in it has gotta be good!",ant_man
Scott Lang,What?,ant_man
kurt,Old man have safe.,ant_man
Luis,And he’s gone for a week.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Alright. There’s an old man, he’s got a safe, and he’s gone for a week. Let’s just work with that.",ant_man
Luis,Y’know what I’m sayin’?,ant_man
kurt,"Landlines cut, cell signals jammed. No one will be making for distress call tonight.",ant_man

kurt,Check.,ant_man
dave,Check.,ant_man
Luis,"If the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Don’t worry, it’s not gonna happen. [Scott leaves the van]",ant_man

dave,Damn! [through his earpiece] Alarm is dead.,ant_man
Luis,Nice!,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Alright, I’m moving through the house.",ant_man
Scott Lang,There’s a fingerprint lock on the door.,ant_man
Luis,"It’s got a what? Ernesto didn’t tell me nothin’ about that. Aw, man, are we screwed?",ant_man
Scott Lang,Not necessarily.,ant_man
Scott Lang,I’m in.,ant_man
kurt,No alarms have been triggered. He’s in like the Flynn.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Oh, man.",ant_man
Luis,What is it?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Well they weren’t kidding, this safe is serious.",ant_man
Luis,"How serious we talkin’, Scotty?",ant_man
Scott Lang,"It’s a Carbondale. It’s from 1910, made from the same steel as the Titanic.",ant_man
Luis,Wow. Can you crack it?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Well, here’s the thing. It doesn’t do so well in the cold. Remember what that iceberg did?",ant_man
Luis,"Yeah, man, it killed DiCaprio.",ant_man
dave,It killed everybody.,ant_man
kurt,But not the old lady. She still threw the jewel into the oceans.,ant_man
Luis,What are you doing?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen. Ice expands, metal doesn’t.",ant_man
Luis,What are you doing now?,ant_man
Scott Lang,Waiting. Waiting.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Nice.,ant_man
Luis,"What is it, cash? Jewels?",ant_man
Scott Lang,Well there’s nothing here.,ant_man
Luis,What’d you say?,ant_man
Scott Lang,It’s a suit.,ant_man
Luis,What?,ant_man
Scott Lang,It’s an old motorcycle suit.,ant_man
Luis,"There’s no cash, no jewelry, nothing?",ant_man
Scott Lang,No. It’s a bust.,ant_man
Luis,"I’m really sorry, Scotty. I know you needed a score.",ant_man
hope van dyne,I thought we were using mice?,ant_man
darren cross,"What’s the difference? Commence experiment 34C, organic atomic reduction.",ant_man
hope van dyne,"Darren, maybe we should think…",ant_man
darren cross,Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology. I can’t go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Why would you lock this up?,ant_man
Scott Lang,So weird.,ant_man
Luis,"Scott, what’s up man?",ant_man
Scott Lang,I wonder… what is this?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"The world sure seems different from down here, doesn’t it, Scott?",ant_man
Scott Lang,What? Who… who said that?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Luis! Luis, down here!",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"It’s a trial by fire, Scott. Or in this case, water.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Guess you’re tougher than you thought.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Oh, I don’t want to see this.",ant_man
Scott Lang,Luis! Ahh! Son of a… !,ant_man
cab driver,What the hell?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Not bad for a test drive. Keep the suit, I’ll be in touch.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"No, no. No, thank you.",ant_man
cop on speaker,Put it down on the ground! You are under arrest!,ant_man
Scott Lang,"No, I didn’t steal anything! I was returning something I stole.",ant_man
paxton,"You know, you almost had us convinced that you were going to change your ways. They were really rooting for you. It’s gonna break their hearts.",ant_man
detective,You got a visitor.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Who?,ant_man
detective,Your lawyer.,ant_man
Scott Lang,My lawyer?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"I told you I’d be in touch, Scott. I’m starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Oh, man.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Sit down.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Sir, I’m sorry I stole the suit. I don’t even want to know why you have it.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Maggie was right about you.,ant_man
Scott Lang,How do you know about… ?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"The way she’s trying to keep you away from Cassie. The moment things get hard, you turn right back to crime. The way I see it, you have a choice. You can either spend the rest of your life in prison or go back to your cell and await further instructions.",ant_man
Scott Lang,I don’t understand.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"No, I don’t expect you to. But you don’t have many options right now. Quite frankly, neither do I. Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place?",ant_man
Scott Lang,What?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Second chances don’t come around all that much. So next time you think you might see one I suggest you take a real close look at it.,ant_man
maggie lang,[referring to the ugly rabbit toy Scott gave her as Maggie is putting Cassie to sleep] Are you sure you don’t want a different toy?,ant_man
maggie lang,Are you sure you don’t want a different toy?,ant_man
cassie lang,"No, I love this one.",ant_man
maggie lang,"Okay. Well, get some sleep then. I love you. [Maggie kisses Cassie on her head]",ant_man
cassie lang,Mommy?,ant_man
maggie lang,Hm?,ant_man
cassie lang,Is daddy a bad man? I heard some grownups say he’s bad.,ant_man
maggie lang,"No. Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Smart choice. You actually listened for once.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Under the door.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Okay. Where to now?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Hang tight.,ant_man
Scott Lang,What? What?!,ant_man
paxton,Where the hell did he go?,ant_man
detective,"I have no idea, he just vanished. [into his radio] Set up a five block perimeter, now!",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Get back, get back, get back!",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Scott, these are my associates.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Huh? You got a camera on an ant? Yeah, sure, why not? Where’s the car?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"No car, we’ve got wings. Incoming!",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Put your foot on the central node and not the thorax.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Are you ki… ? How safe’s this… ?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Get on the damn ant, Scott!",ant_man
Scott Lang,Why am I on a police car? Shouldn’t I not be on a police car?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,So they can give you a lift past their five block perimeter.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Whoa. Alright. Now, what’s the next move?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Hang on tight.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Oh, this is easy. I’m getting the hang of this. Yank up to go up. It’s like a horse.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,You’re throwing 2-47 off balance.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Wait, his name is 2-47?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"He doesn’t have a name, he has a number Scott. Do you have any idea how many ants there are?",ant_man
Scott Lang,Whoa!,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Maybe it’s 2-48.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"No, no, no, no! Vertigo, vertigo!",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"No, I think it’s 2-47.",ant_man
Scott Lang,Wait.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Hang on.,ant_man
Scott Lang,I think I’m getting the hang of this.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I’m controlling 2-47. He is not listening to you.,ant_man
Scott Lang,What? Can I make one little request?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,No.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Stop 2-47. Time out, time out. Time out. Alright, hold on. Just, wait. Whoa, uh! What happens if I throw up in this helmet?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"It’s my helmet, Scott. Do not throw up.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Just set her down, alright? I’m getting light headed.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Hang on, Scott.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Yeah, I’m getting a little light… it’s funny… hit me, and…",ant_man
Scott Lang,Hello. Who are you? Have you been standing there watching me sleep this whole time?,ant_man
hope van dyne,Yes.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Why?,ant_man
hope van dyne,Because the last time you were here you stole something.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Oh. Oh! Hey, look.",ant_man
Scott Lang,Whoa!,ant_man
hope van dyne,Paraponera clavata. Giant tropical bullet ants. Ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index. They’re here to keep an eye on you when I can’t. Dr. Pym’s waiting for you downstairs.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Who? [calling out to Hope] Hey, um, whose pajamas are these? [gets no response] How am I supposed to do this?",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Right, just one step at a time.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Ugh. You don’t bite me, I don’t step on you, deal?",ant_man
hope van dyne,Take down the servers and Cross wouldn’t even know it. We don’t need this guy. [Scott enters the dining room where Pym and Hope are sat],ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I assume that you’ve already met my daughter Hope.,ant_man
Scott Lang,I did. She’s great.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,She doesn’t think that we need you.,ant_man
hope van dyne,We don’t. We can do this ourselves.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit, and then Hope has you arrested.",ant_man
hope van dyne,"Okay, we can try this and when he fails I’ll do it myself.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"She’s a little bit anxious. It has to do with this job, which, judging by the fact that you’re sitting opposite me, I take it that you’re interested in.",ant_man
Scott Lang,What job?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Would you like some tea?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Uh, sure. [Pym pours Scott some tea]",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security system. Freezing that metal was particularly clever.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Were you watching me?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Scott, I’ve been watching you for a while, ever since you robbed Vista Corp. Oh, excuse me, burgled Vista Corp. [Scott see Hope smile to herself] Vista’s security system is one of the most advanced in the business. It’s supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it. Would you like some sugar?",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Yeah, thanks. [he sees two ants pushing two sugar cubes on the table towards his cup] You know what, I’m okay. [referring to the ants] How do you make them do that?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Ants can lift objects fifty times their weight. They build, farm, they cooperate with each other.",ant_man
Scott Lang,Right. But how do you make them do that? [he sees the ants returning the sugar cubes into their bowl],ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center. I speak to them. I can go anywhere, hear anything, and see everything.",ant_man
hope van dyne,And still know absolutely nothing. I’m late to meet Cross. [Hope gets up and leaves] [Scott raises his hand to ask a question],ant_man
Scott Lang,Uh… Dr. Pym?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"You don’t need to raise your hand, Scott.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Sorry, I just have one question. Who are you? Who is she? What the hell’s going on and can I go back to jail now?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Come with me. [Pym takes Scott to his lab] Twenty years ago I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Huh?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"I learned how to change the distance between atoms, that’s what powers the suit, that’s why it works. [they enter Pym’s lab]",ant_man
Scott Lang,Whoa.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,But it was dangerous. It was too dangerous. So I hid it from the world. And that’s when I switched gears and I started my own company.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Pym Tech.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Yes. I took on a young protégé called Darren Cross.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Darren Cross. He’s a big deal.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"But before he was a big deal he was my assistant. I thought I saw something in him, a son I never had perhaps. He was brilliant, but as we became close he began to suspect that I wasn’t telling him everything. He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particles, and he became obsessed with recreating my formula. But I wouldn’t help him so he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company.",ant_man
Scott Lang,How could he do that?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"The board’s chairman is my daughter, Hope. She was the deciding vote. But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula. The process is highly volatile. What isn’t protected by a specialized helmet can affect the brain’s chemistry. I don’t think Darren realizes this, and you know, he’s not the most stable guy to begin with.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"So, what do you want from me?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption. Do you?",ant_man
Scott Lang,I do.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"If you can help me, I promise I can help you be with your daughter again. Now are you ready to redeem yourself?",ant_man
Scott Lang,Absolutely. My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done. What do you want me to do?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"I want you to break into a place and steal some shit. [Paxton receives a text from his partner, Gale, as he’s sat having breakfast with Maggie and Cassie]",ant_man
maggie lang,"You going to be home for dinner tonight? [Paxton reads the text, “Lang’s “Lawyer” is Dr. Hank Pym, as in Pym Tech]",ant_man
paxton,"Uh, yeah. I’ll pick something up, text you.",ant_man
maggie lang,Okay. Good news? [Paxton gets up to leave],ant_man
paxton,"Uh, I don’t know. It’s news.",ant_man
cassie lang,Are you trying to find my daddy?,ant_man
paxton,"Yeah, I am, sweetheart. I just want your daddy to be safe.",ant_man
cassie lang,Hope you don’t catch him. [Pym is showing Scott photos of the people he used to worked with],ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"This isn’t the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on game changing weaponry. That’s Mitchell Carson, ex-head of defense at SHIELD, presently in the business of toppling governments. He always wanted my tech, and now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket and destroy all the data, Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.",ant_man
Scott Lang,I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I’ve spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark. I’m sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now. This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit. This could change the texture of reality. Besides they’re probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Okay, then why don’t you just send the ants?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Scott, they are ants. Ants, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader. Somebody that can infiltrate a place that’s designed to prevent infiltration.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Hank, I’m a thief. Alright? I’m a good thief. But this is insane. [just then Hope enters the lab]",ant_man
hope van dyne,"He’s right Hank and you know it. You’ve seen the footage, you know what Cross is capable of. I was against using him when we had months, now we have days. I’m wearing the suit.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Absolutely not!,ant_man
hope van dyne,"I know the facility inside and out, I know how Cross thinks. I know this mission better than anybody here.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,We need you close to Cross otherwise this mission cannot work.,ant_man
hope van dyne,We don’t have time to screw around.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Hope, please. Listen to me, please…",ant_man
hope van dyne,He is a criminal. I’m your daughter.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"No! [Pym turns and sits down, Hope walks off in disappointment]",ant_man
Scott Lang,"She’s right, Hank. I’m not your guy. Why don’t you wear the suit?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"You think I don’t want to? I can’t. I spent years wearing it. It took a toll on me. You’re our only option. Before Hope lost her mother, she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world. And now she looks at me and it’s just disappointment. It’s too late for me, but not for you. This is your chance. The chance to earn that look in your daughter’s eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are. It’s not about saving our world, it’s about saving theirs.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Damn, that was a good speech.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Scott, I need you to be the Ant-Man.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"In the right hands, the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic. The suit has power, the man harnesses that power. You need to be skillful, agile, and above all, you need to be fast. You should be able to shrink and grow on a dime, so your size always suits your needs. [Hope closes the door] Now dive through the keyhole, Scott. You charge big, you dive small, then you emerge big. [Scott puts on the helmet and charges for the keyhole]",ant_man
Scott Lang,Ow! [we hear him fail several times as he continues to shrink and dive through the keyhole] Ah! Ow.,ant_man
hope van dyne,[to Pym] Useless.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"When you’re small energy is compressed so you have the force of a two hundred pound man behind a fist a hundredth of an inch wide, you’re like a bullet. You punch too hard, you kill someone, too soft, it’s a love-tap. In other words you have to know how to punch.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"I was in prison for three years, I know how to punch.",ant_man
hope van dyne,Show me. [she puts up her hands and Scott hits her hand] Terrible.,ant_man
Scott Lang,You want to show me how to punch? [he puts up his hand like hers] Show me… [suddenly Hope punches him in the face knocking him back],ant_man
hope van dyne,That’s how you punch.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,She’s been looking forward to this.,ant_man
Scott Lang,No kiddin’.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Hope trained in martial arts at a, uh, difficult time.",ant_man
hope van dyne,"Oh, by difficult time, he means when my mother died.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,We lost her in a plane crash.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"It’s bad enough you won’t tell me how she died, could you please stop telling me that lie. We’re working here. [as Scott is still recovering from her punch] Alright princess, let’s get back to work.",ant_man
Scott Lang,Were you going for the hand?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"You know, I think this regulator is holding me back.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Do not screw with the regulator. If that regulator is compromised you would go sub-atomic.,ant_man
Scott Lang,What does that mean?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,It means that you would enter a quantum realm.,ant_man
Scott Lang,What does *that* mean?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity. Everything that you know, and love, gone forever.",ant_man
Scott Lang,Cool. Yeah. I’m… if it ain’t broke.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"Paratrechina longicornis, commonly known as crazy ants, they’re lightning fast and can conduct electricity which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics. [Scott comes across a crazy ant]",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Oh, you’re not so crazy. [the crazy ant jumps on him, knocking Scott back] Hey! You’re cute. [suddenly a herd of crazy ants crawl all over Scott] Oh! Aaah! [Scott turns himself back to normal size and he pops up through the ground] That was a lot scarier a second ago.",ant_man
Scott Lang,It looks like the Futures lab has its own isolated power supply.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"There’s a security guard posted around the clock, we’ll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems.",ant_man
Scott Lang,Okay. Who’s next? [a massive ant comes up behind Scott],ant_man
hope van dyne,Paraponera clavata.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"I know. Bullet ants, right? Number one on the Schmidt pain index. [to the ants] Hey, guys! Remember me from the bedroom? [as the ant goes to attack Scott pops back up the through the ground in his normal size] Whoa!",ant_man
hope van dyne,The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about five millimeters in diameter.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?,ant_man
hope van dyne,The tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down for fifteen seconds.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"You’re going to need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers, retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults, before the backup power comes on.",ant_man
hope van dyne,[looking at another ant] Camponotus pennsylvanicus.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Alternatively known as a carpenter ant. Ideal for ground and air transport.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Wait a minute, I know this guy. I’m going to call him Ant-thony.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"That’s good. That’s very good, because this time you’re really going to have to learn how to control him. [we see the ants pushing sugar cubes on the table] Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Oh, you okay, d… [Hope suddenly punches Scott in the face and then knocks him down with her legs]",ant_man
hope van dyne,Hank wants you outside for target practice.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,The suit has no weapons so I made you these discs. Red shrinks. Blue enlarges.,ant_man
hope van dyne,[referring to another species of ant] Solenopsis mandibularis.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Known for their bite, the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects. They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"You can do it Scott, come on. [one of the ants flies off and Scott takes off his earpiece in frustration]",ant_man
Scott Lang,They’re not listening to me.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"You have to commit, you have to mean it. No shortcuts, no lies.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, Hope.",ant_man
hope van dyne,We don’t have time for coddling.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Our focus should be on helping Scott!,ant_man
hope van dyne,"Really? Is that where our focus should be? [Hope picks up the earpiece and uses it to instruct the ants to put the sugar cube into the teacup, then she gets a herd of ants to appear]",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Hope! [looking upset Hope walks over to Pym],ant_man
hope van dyne,I don’t know why I came to you in the first place. [Hope leaves],ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,We can’t do this without her.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"Oh, God.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"You gotta lock your doors. I mean, really. There’s some weird folks in this neighborhood.",ant_man
hope van dyne,Do you think this is a joke? Do you have any idea what he’s asking you to risk? You have a daughter.,ant_man
Scott Lang,I’m doing this for her.,ant_man
hope van dyne,You know when my mother died I didn’t see him for two weeks?,ant_man
Scott Lang,He was in grief.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"Yeah, so was I, and I was seven. And he never came back, not in any way that counted. He just sent me off to boarding school. You know, I thought, with all that’s at stake, just maybe we might have a chance at making peace. But even now he still wants to shut me out.",ant_man
Scott Lang,He doesn’t want to shut you out. He trusts you.,ant_man
hope van dyne,Then why are you here?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"It proves that he loves you. Hope. Look at me. I’m expendable, that’s why I’m here. You must’ve realized that by now. I mean, that’s why I’m in the suit and you’re not. He’d rather lose than fight than lose you. Anyway… [Scott goes to get out of the car]",ant_man
hope van dyne,"You know, I didn’t know you had a… a daughter when I called the cops on you. What’s her name?",ant_man
Scott Lang,Cassie.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"It’s a pretty name. You have to clear your mind, Scott. You have to make your thoughts precise, that’s how it works. Think about Cassie, about how badly you want to see her, and use that to focus. [she gives Scott the earpiece back to talk to the ants and places a coin on the dashboard] Open your eyes and just think about what you want the ants to do. [couple of ants arrive and Scott gets them to pick up the coin] That’s good. [they watch as Scott gets the ants to spin the coin]",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions. They called her the Wasp. She was born to it. And there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t regret having said yes. It was 1987, separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk and launched an ICBM at the United States. The only way to the internal mechanics was through solid titanium.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile, but my regulator had sustained too much damage. Your mother, she didn’t hesitate.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Janet! No!,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,She turned off her regulator and went sub-atomic to deactivate the bomb. She was gone. Your mom died a hero. And I spent the next ten years trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.,ant_man
hope van dyne,You were trying to bring her back.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,But all I learned was we know nothing.,ant_man
hope van dyne,It’s not your fault. She made her choice. But why didn’t you tell me this sooner?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I was trying to protect you. I lost your mother. I didn’t mean to lose you too. [Hope begins to cry],ant_man
hope van dyne,I’m sorry.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"This is awesome. It’s awesome, you know? You guys are breaking down walls, you’re healing. It’s important. [Hope and Pym turn to look at him] I ruined the moment didn’t I?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Yes, you did, yes.",ant_man
Scott Lang,I’m gonna make some tea. [Scott turns and leaves],ant_man
Scott Lang,Nailed it!,ant_man
Scott Lang,"That’s a good boy, Ant-thony.",ant_man
Scott Lang,The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.,ant_man
Scott Lang,It’s freezing! You couldn’t make a suit with a flannel lining?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"We must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy, it’s a device that I invented from my SHIELD days.",ant_man
hope van dyne,We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,It’s currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark’s old storage facilities in upstate New York. Should be a piece of cake.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"You’re over the target area. Disengage, now, Scott.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Squadron A, go. B, go. C, go. Alright, Ant-thony, please don’t drop me this time. [they jump off the plane] Ah, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Stay calm.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"[approaching the ""old Stark warehouse"" he's supposed to burglarize] Uh, guys, we might have a problem. Hank, didn’t you say this was some old warehouse? [The ""warehouse"" comes into clearer view, with a large circle-A insignia on the roof denoting its role as the Avengers' base] It’s not! [we see that the warehouse is the new Avengers base] You son of a bitch!",ant_man
hope van dyne,"Scott, get out of there.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Abort! Abort now.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"No, it’s okay. It doesn’t look like anyone’s home. Ant-thony, get me to the roof.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,He’s gonna lose the suit.,ant_man
hope van dyne,He’s gonna lose his life.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Alright I’m on the roof of the target building.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"Somebody’s home, Scott. [just then Sam Wilson in his Falcon flies in]",ant_man
voice over radio,"[on Sam’s radio] What’s going on down there, Sam?",ant_man
Scott Lang,It’s the Falcon!,ant_man
Sam Wilson,[into his radio] I had a sensor trip but I’m not seeing anything. Wait a second.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Abort, Scott! Abort now.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"It’s okay, he can’t see me.",ant_man
Sam Wilson,I can see you.,ant_man
Scott Lang,He can see me. [Scott enlarges himself back to normal size and waves to Falcon] Hi. I’m Scott.,ant_man
hope van dyne,Did he just say “Hi I’m Scott?”,ant_man
Sam Wilson,What are you doing here?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"First off, I’m a big fan.",ant_man
Sam Wilson,Appreciate it. So who the hell are you?,ant_man
Scott Lang,I’m Ant-Man. [Sam smiles] Ant-Man?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"What, you haven’t heard of me? No, you wouldn’t have heard of me.",ant_man
Sam Wilson,You want to tell me what you want?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology just for a few days, and then return it. I need it to save the world. You know how that is.",ant_man
Sam Wilson,I know exactly how that is. [into his radio] Located the breach. Bringing him in.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Sorry about this! [just as Sam goes to grab Scott he shrinks himself, hits Sam and runs off]",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,What the hell are you doing? [Sam chases after Scott],ant_man
Sam Wilson,Breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech. [Sam flies in and lands to stamp on Scott but Scott manages to intercept it and fights off Sam],ant_man
scot lang,Sorry. Sorry about this. Sorry [Scott jumps around Sam while punching him],ant_man
Sam Wilson,That’s enough! [Sam punches Scott as he jumps at him],ant_man
Scott Lang,"Ant-thony, a little help. [Ant-thony flies in, Scott jump on his back and they fly into a vent and Sam goes to find him]",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I’ve lost visual! [suddenly Sam bursts through one of the facility doors],ant_man
Sam Wilson,He’s inside my pack.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Sorry. You seem like a really great guy. [they fight but Scott gets manages to disable Sam’s flight pack then flies off on Ant-thony; into his radio],ant_man
Sam Wilson,It’s really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,That was completely irresponsible and dangerous! You jeopardized everything! [Scott takes Pym’s signal decoy out of his pocket and places it on the table],ant_man
hope van dyne,You got it. [Scott nods his head],ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Well done.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Wait a minute. Did you just compliment me? He did, didn’t he?",ant_man
hope van dyne,Kind of sounded like he did.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"I was good, wasn’t I?",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger, and didn’t die?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Now let’s not dwell on the past. We gotta finish our planning. [Pym turns and leaves with the signal decoy],ant_man
hope van dyne,Don’t mind him. You did good. [Pym enters his living room to find Cross standing there],ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Darren. How the hell did you get in here? [Pym closes the door],ant_man
darren cross,"You left the front door open, Hank. It’s official. You’re old. [Hope and Scott hear them from the kitchen]",ant_man
hope van dyne,The plans! He will kill him. [back with Cross and Pym],ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Well to what do I owe this pleasure?,ant_man
darren cross,I have good news.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Really? What’s that?,ant_man
darren cross,"Pym Tech, the company you created, is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world. We’re anticipating fifteen billion in sales tomorrow alone. [Pym says nothing, at the same time Scott gets some ants to roll up their plans on the nearby table] You’re welcome. I know this is odd, but I’d like you to be there. This is my moment, I want you to see it.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure. I’ll be there.",ant_man
darren cross,What did you see in me?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I don’t know what you mean.,ant_man
darren cross,"All those years ago, you picked me. What did you see?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I saw myself.,ant_man
darren cross,Then why did you push me away?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Because I saw too much of myself. [Cross turns and leaves] [after Cross leaves],ant_man
hope van dyne,"He knows, he’s baiting you! We have to call it off.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,We’re all taking risks.,ant_man
hope van dyne,What if he saw me here?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,He didn’t. There’s no way.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"How do you know that? [just then Hope gets a call from Cross] Darren, hi.",ant_man
darren cross,"Hope, where are you right now?",ant_man
hope van dyne,"I’m at home, why?",ant_man
darren cross,I just saw Hank. I still get nothing but contempt from him.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"Don’t let him rile you up, he’s just… he’s just a senile old man.",ant_man
darren cross,"We need to start everyone working around the clock, get the assembly line up and running. And I’m tripling security. Full sensors at all entrances, and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh.",ant_man
hope van dyne,Great. Good idea.,ant_man
darren cross,"Thank you, Hope. I’m so lucky to have you on my team.",ant_man
hope van dyne,"He’s tripling security, he’s lost his mind, and he’s on to you.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,But he is not on to you.,ant_man
hope van dyne,He’s adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior vents. How are we gonna get Scott inside?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"The water main. You can’t add security to a water main. The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it, that’s how I get in.",ant_man
hope van dyne,"Somebody would have to reach the building’s control center to change the water pressure. I mean, Hank and I will be beside Cross, how are we supposed to do that?",ant_man
Scott Lang,"So we expand our team. What do we need? A fake security guard on the inside to depressurize the water system, somebody else to hack into the power supply and kill the laser grid, and a getaway guy.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.",ant_man
Luis,"Thank you for the coffee ma’am. It’s not too often that you rob a place, and then get welcomed back. Because we just robbed you!",ant_man
hope van dyne,"[to Scott] You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?",ant_man
Luis,Two smoothie machines.,ant_man
hope van dyne,Are you sure they can handle this?,ant_man
Luis,"Oh we can handle it, we’re professionals.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,You’ll forgive us if we’re not instilled with confidence.,ant_man
dave,"Wait, everybody. Just kick back and relax a little bit, man. we know our business. We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn’t we?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,I let you.,ant_man
dave,"Well, one could say that I let you let me.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Look, it’s okay. They can handle this.",ant_man
Luis,"Yeah, we can handle it.",ant_man
Scott Lang,You got their credentials?,ant_man
hope van dyne,He’s in the system.,ant_man
Luis,I’m in the system?,ant_man
dave,The system.,ant_man
Luis,The system?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Yeah. We’re doomed.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Alright, there’s something you guys need to see.",ant_man
Luis,"Damn! Whoa! That’s so cool, bro!",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Now look, this is gonna get weird, alright? It’s pretty freaky but it’s safe. There’s no reason to be scared.",ant_man
Luis,"Aw, no, no. Daddy don’t get scared.",ant_man
Scott Lang,Really?,ant_man
Luis,Yeah.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Good. [Scott shrinks himself freaking out Luis, Dave and Kurt]",ant_man
Luis,Oh!,ant_man
kurt,This is the work of the gypsies.,ant_man
dave,That’s… that’s… that’s witchcraft.,ant_man
Luis,"Oh, that’s amazing. That’s like some David Copperfield shit.",ant_man
dave,That’s some kind of wizardry.,ant_man
kurt,Sorcery!,ant_man
Luis,Ahh! Ahh! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! [runs out of the room] Get off! Get off! Ahh! [Luis runs off trying to get Scott off his shoulder],ant_man
Scott Lang,I thought daddy didn’t get scared?,ant_man
hope van dyne,I gave them each half a Xanax and Hank explained the science of the suit to them. Fell right asleep.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Hey, look. I want to thank you for…",ant_man
hope van dyne,"No, please don’t. We’re all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us. I’m just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Hey. Thank you, you know, for that pep talk.",ant_man
hope van dyne,"You know, the honest truth is I actually went from despising you to almost liking you.",ant_man
Scott Lang,You really should write poetry. [Hope laughs],ant_man
hope van dyne,"Get some sleep, Scott. [Hope leaves]",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Alright, just so we’re clear, everyone here knows their role, right? Dave?",ant_man
dave,Wheels on the ground.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Kurt?,ant_man
kurt,Eyes in the sky.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Luis?,ant_man
Luis,"Aw, man, you know it. You know what, I get to wear a uniform, that’s what’s up.",ant_man
Scott Lang,Luis.,ant_man
Luis,"I’m sorry, I mean, I’m good, I’m good. I’m just excited, and plus you’re girlfriend’s really hot, so you know that makes me nervous too. [to Hope] And you are very beautiful, ma’am.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Oh, my lord.",ant_man
Scott Lang,She’s not my…,ant_man
Luis,"Hey, you know what? I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover, like a whistling, you know I’m saying? To like, blend in.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"No, don’t whistle. No whistling. It’s not the Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.",ant_man
kurt,We’re set.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Wish me luck. [Scott gets out, shrinks himself as he goes through the water main]",ant_man
kurt,Utility is online.,ant_man
alpha guard,Hey. What are you doing?,ant_man
Luis,"Uh, boss-man said to secure the area. So, I’m securing.",ant_man
alpha guard,I’m the boss.,ant_man
Luis,Oh.,ant_man
alpha guard,"[into his radio] Utilities work room three… [Luis suddenly punches him, knocking him out unconscious and then lowers the water level]",ant_man
kurt,Water level is dropping.,ant_man
kurt,Coming up on extraction pipe.,ant_man
Scott Lang,"I see it! [to the ants] Alright, come on. I gotta get up there. That’s it, that’s it, guys, yeah! [the ants help him climb up to the extraction pipe] That’s it, yeah. Yes! You got it! You got it, come on! [Scott makes it through one of the handwash sinks in the bathroom] Alright, let’s fly Ant-thony. [Scott and the ants fly off]",ant_man
kurt,The Ant-Man is in the building.,ant_man
dave,Phshh. Got a Crown Vic right outside over there.,ant_man
kurt,This is problem?,ant_man
dave,"Considering the Crown Vic’s the most commonly used car for under-cover cops, man. Yes, this is a problem. [inside the Crown Vic is Paxton and Gale]",ant_man
paxton,That’s Pym. [they get out to go after Pym],ant_man
kurt,"Oh, no.",ant_man
Scott Lang,I’m employing the bullet ants. Hapanera-clamda-mana-merna. I don’t remember what it’s called but I feel bad for this guy. [using the ants Scott takes down one of the security guards with Luis also punching him],ant_man
Luis,"See, that’s what I’m talkin’ bout. That’s what I call it, an unfortunate casualty, in a very serious operation, you know? [Hope then comes along and enters the room and places the signal decoy]",ant_man
kurt,"Signal decoy in place. Mean pretty lady did good, Scott.",ant_man
dave,Looks like Pym’s getting arrested.,ant_man
kurt,"Scott, we have problem.",ant_man
Scott Lang,Problem? What’s the problem? [just then Dave gets out of the can],ant_man
kurt,"Dave! Dave, that’s not part of plan!",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"[as Paxton and Gale are trying to arrest Pym] Listen to me, if I don’t get into this building people will die.",ant_man
gale,That’s awfully dramatic.,ant_man
paxton,Are you kidding me?! [they run after Dave as he drives off in their car],ant_man
kurt,Problem solved.,ant_man
darren cross,"Well. How do I look? [they then find Pym as he enters the building] There he is. Just in time. Come on. [Cross takes them to vault where he’s keeping the Yellowjacket suit, and uses an eye scanner to open the door]",ant_man
computer,Twelve point verification.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Little over the top, don’t you think, Darren?",ant_man
computer,Confirming authorization.,ant_man
darren cross,"No, you can never be too safe.",ant_man
computer,Access granted. [they enter the vault],ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"I gotta hand it to you, Darren, you really did it.",ant_man
darren cross,"And you only know the half of it, Hank. [at the same time Carson arrives with his men]",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Arriving at second position. Alright, top speed, Ant-thony! Let’s go. [Scott and Ant-thony fly towards where the Yellowjacket suit is being kept] Proceeding to command position. [Scott jumps off Ant-thony] I’ll be right back, Ant-thony. Alright, guys, I’m in position. I’m going to signal the ants. [Paxton and Gale find their car dumped can crashed into a tree]",ant_man
paxton,"No, no, no, no! [Dave gets back into the van with Kurt]",ant_man
dave,Did you see that? [he honks the musical horn which Paxton recognizes from Scott using it earlier],ant_man
Scott Lang,"Assume formation. Alright you cute little crazies, let’s fry these servers. [the ants fry the servers and Scott jumps back onto Ant-thony] Let’s go get ‘em, buddy!",ant_man
kurt,Servers are fried. Data backup completely erased.,ant_man
Scott Lang,Headed to the particle chamber.,ant_man
mitchell carson,"Hello, Dr. Cross. My associates agree to your terms.",ant_man
darren cross,"Wonderful. [to Pym] They’re not what they were, they’re doing some interesting work. And I’m enjoying myself. You tried to hide your technology from me, and now it’s gonna blow up in your face. [suddenly Pym punches Cross in the face] Wow. Wow! I mean, I saw the punch coming a mile away but I just figured it’d be all pathetic and weak.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Well you figured wrong.,ant_man
paxton,I know this van. [he bangs on the van door] Anybody home?,ant_man
dave,[to each other inside the van] Shh.,ant_man
kurt,Shh.,ant_man
dave,Shh!,ant_man
kurt,Shh!,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Alright, guys, I’m here. Setting the charges. [Scott set the explosives; to the ants] Great job, guys. I’ll take it from here. [Ant-thony sets Scott down] Good boy, Ant-thony. Final position. [to Kurt and Dave] Guys, how we lookin’ on that laser grid?",ant_man
kurt,Almost!,ant_man
dave,"No, you’re not.",ant_man
kurt,I’m getting close!,ant_man
dave,"No, you’re not. [Paxton keeps banging on Luis’s van door]",ant_man
paxton,San Francisco PD! Man in the van! I know you’re in there! [inside the van as they wait for the laser grid to be disabled],ant_man
dave,Make it go faster.,ant_man
kurt,"Dude, seriously!",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?",ant_man
kurt,It’s so close.,ant_man
paxton,"[suddenly the van door opens, Paxton and Gale point their guns at Kurt and Dave] Freeze!",ant_man
dave,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute! there was a black guy that looked exactly like me who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.",ant_man
paxton,Get out.,ant_man
dave,Take it easy!,ant_man
kurt,[Paxton pulls Kurt out of the van at the same time the laser grid is disabled; to Scott] Go! Go now! [Scott jumps to get to the Yellowjacket] Wait!,ant_man
Scott Lang,What? What do you mean wait? [Kurt manages to struggle free from Paxton’s hold to press a button on his computer to fully disable the lasers and just as Scott goes to grab the suit it’s pulled away] What? What? [Cross sees Scott and taps on the glass],ant_man
darren cross,"Hi, little guy. [to Pym] I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere, which begs the question, who is the new Ant-Man? Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me? [pauses a moment] Scott Lang. The martyr, who took on the system and paid the price, losing his family and his only daughter in the process. Exactly your kind of guy, Hank. He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how, and then, he disappears magically, despite having no money to his name, and now he brings me the Ant-Man suit, the only thing that can rival my creation.",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Darren, don’t do this. If you sell to these men, it’s going to be chaos.",ant_man
darren cross,"I already have, and for twice the price, thanks to you. It’s not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility. Thankfully, word travels fast. Oh, I’ll sell them the Yellowjacket, but I’m keeping the particle to myself. They don’t run on diesel. If you want the fuel you’ll have to come to me. What do you call the only man who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,The most powerful man in the world.,ant_man
darren cross,You proud of me yet?,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"You can stop this, Darren. It’s not too late.",ant_man
darren cross,It’s been too late for a long time now. [one of the men in the chamber points their gun at Pym],ant_man
hope van dyne,"Darren, what are you doing?",ant_man
darren cross,He wasn’t any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.,ant_man
hope van dyne,"This is not who you are, it’s the particles altering your brain chemistry.",ant_man
darren cross,"[to the guy pointing a gun at Pym] Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You’re right, I have to be the one to do it. [he points a gun at Pym’s head, at the same time Hope takes out her weapon and points it at Cross]",ant_man
mitchell carson,Here we go.,ant_man
hope van dyne,Drop your gun.,ant_man
darren cross,"You know I came to the house the other night to kill him, but you were there.",ant_man
hope van dyne,You’re sick and I can help you just put the gun down.,ant_man
darren cross,"I wasn’t ready to kill you then, but I think I am now!",ant_man
hope van dyne,"Drop your gun, now!",ant_man
darren cross,"You picked the wrong side, Hope. [just then Scott breaks out using the disc Pym gave him that turn things large, he starts fighting off the men in the chamber and Pym is shot in the chaos]",ant_man
hope van dyne,Dad! [grabbing hold of the wounded Pym],ant_man
Scott Lang,"Hank. No, no. Hank. Hank. Listen, you’re gonna be okay. Alright? You’re gonna be just fine. [Cross comes up behind Scott and points his gun at the back of Scott’s head]",ant_man
darren cross,"Take the suit off or I’ll blow your brains out and peel it off! [Scott instructs the ants to disable Cross’ gun and bite him, so he takes off and the same time Carson takes off with vial of Cross’ particles]",ant_man
paxton,"[Luis sets off the alarm to the building; into his radio] We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech, request immediate backup.",ant_man
dave,"[Paxton and Gale head off; to Kurt] Go, go, go! [Dave and Kurt get into the van and drive off]",ant_man
hope van dyne,"[inside the vault] Dad, can you move?",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,Yes.,ant_man
Scott Lang,We need to get him out of here.,ant_man
hope van dyne,Go get that suit. [Scott takes off and tries to get away from the two guards shooting at him],ant_man
Luis,"Hey, Scotty. Hey, did I save your life? Scotty? Scotty? [Scott makes himself large again]",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Thank you, Luis.",ant_man
Luis,"Hey, are we the good guys?",ant_man
Scott Lang,Yeah.,ant_man
Luis,"We’re the good guys, right?",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Yeah, we’re the good guys.",ant_man
Luis,"Feels kind of weird, you know?",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Yeah, but we’re not done yet. Get out of here before this place blows. [Scott shrinks himself and takes off]",ant_man
Luis,"[as Luis tries to leave the building he remembers the guard he knocked out earlier] Oh, dammit! That guy. [he opens the door and rushes to the guard who is tied up] Hey! We’re getting out of here! [back inside the vault Hope helps Pym sit up]",ant_man
hope van dyne,The charges are set. We’ve got to find a way out of here and fast.,ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"Don’t worry. I’m not gonna die, and neither are you. [he holds up a keychain that looks like a tank] It’s not a keychain.",ant_man
paxton,[into his radio] All the chaos in here! Multiple shots fired. [suddenly a tank bursts out through the building] And there’s a tank. [Luis then walks out of the building with the guard],ant_man
Luis,"A little help. [someone takes hold of the guard, at the same time Hope helps Pym out of the tank] I got him. [Luis helps Pym]",ant_man
hope van dyne,We need a doctor! [a medic comes over to help Pym],ant_man
darren cross,"Let’s go! [just as they are about to leave Cross sees a swarm of flung ants heading towards him with Scott on Ant-thony, Cross takes out a gun and starts shooting and one of the bullets hits Ant-thony]",ant_man
Scott Lang,Ant-thony! [Scott falls onto another ant],ant_man
darren cross,Go! [the helicopter door is closed],ant_man
Scott Lang,You’re gonna regret that. [Cross’ helicopter takes off] [Paxton sees Luis as he gets into his van],ant_man
paxton,Wait a minute! Get out of that van!,ant_man
Luis,What?,ant_man
paxton,Get out of that van!,ant_man
Luis,"It’s too loud there’s a tank, I can’t hear you! [he closes the van door and Dave drives off]",ant_man
paxton,Hey! Hey! [Scott makes it into Cross’ helicopter and Cross starts shooting at him],ant_man
darren cross,Did you think you could stop the future with a heist?,ant_man
Scott Lang,It was never just a heist! [Scott sets off charges set around Pym Technologies and Cross watches in shock as the whole building is destroyed] Put the gun down!,ant_man
darren cross,I’m gonna disintegrate you! [inside the briefcase they accidentally hit the cell phone],ant_man
cell phone,Playing “Disintegration” by The Cure. [“Disintegration” by The Cure starts playing as Scott and Cross continue to fight]],ant_man
pool bbq dad,Call 911! [Scott and Cross continue to fight shrinking and growing until Scott swats Cross into a bug zapper],ant_man
Scott Lang,It’s okay. [the family runs off in fear],ant_man
gale,Police! Put your hands up!,ant_man
paxton,Get ‘em up! [Scott pulls up his helmet] Scott?,ant_man
Scott Lang,"Paxton, you have to listen to me- [as Scott goes to walk towards Paxton they taser him and falls down unconscious]",ant_man
paxton,"I’m taking you back, to prison.",ant_man
Scott Lang,"There’s something in that backyard that needs to be destroyed. In the bug zapper, it…",ant_man
paxton,[Paxton suddenly stops the car and turns to Scott] You need to desist right now! Your delusions are out of hand!,ant_man
police radio,All units we have a 236 in progress at 840 Winter Street.,ant_man
Scott Lang,It’s Cassie! [Paxton takes off towards his house],ant_man
darren cross,Don’t be scared. [Paxton pulls up outside his house],ant_man
paxton,"Maggie, what’s going on?",ant_man
maggie lang,He’s got Cassie!,ant_man
paxton,Who’s got Cassie?,ant_man
maggie lang,"That thing, that thing! I don’t know what it… ! [back in Paxton’s car, Scott manages to put on his helmet, shrinks and takes off]",ant_man
cassie lang,Are you a monster?,ant_man
darren cross,Do I look like a monster?,ant_man
cassie lang,I want my daddy!,ant_man
darren cross,"I want your daddy too. [he picks up Cassie and she screams, just then Scott shows up] There you are.",ant_man
cassie lang,"Daddy, is that you? [Scott pulls up his helmet]",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Hi, Peanut. [to Cross] Why don’t you pick on someone your own size? [he throws a disc at Cross which shrinks him then he shrinks himself, Cross is now on the Thomas The Tank Engine toy in Cassie’s room]",ant_man
darren cross,"Now where did you go, little guy? [he spots Scott running towards him] There you are. [he starts firing lasers from his suit at Scott]",ant_man
Scott Lang,"Not just me. [a swarm of ants follow behind Scott] Get him! Go! Go! [Cross fights off the ants as they attack him, then Scott and Cross fight across the Thomas The Tank Engine toy]",ant_man
Luis,"[as they drive towards Paxton’s house] Scotty needs us, you know what I’m sayin’? Ain’t nothin’ gonna stop us. [they stop as they see a load of police cars and cops surrounding the house] Back it up. Back it up slow.",ant_man
dave,Yeah. [Dave starts to slowly back the van away],ant_man
Luis,Just back it up.,ant_man
dave,"Yep, yep.",ant_man
Luis,Back it up.,ant_man
dave,Okay.,ant_man
Luis,"All we gonna do is, we ju… we just back it up.",ant_man
dave,Okay. That’s it.,ant_man
Luis,Back it up.,ant_man

Luis,Back it up.,ant_man
dave,Yep.,ant_man
Luis,"Okay, now-now-now. Just back it up.",ant_man
darren cross,"[as they continue to fight in Cassie’s room inside the Thomas The Tank Engine railway] You insult me, Scott. Your very existence is insulting to me.

Scott Lang,"Yeah, I agree. [Scott throws two discs at Cross, he deflects it one hitting an ant the other the Thomas The Tank Engine toy and they both grow large]",ant_man
paxton,Cassie! [Paxton runs into the house],ant_man
darren cross,I’m gonna show you just how insignificant you are. [Paxton goes to run up the stairs],ant_man
paxton,"Cassie, I’m coming! [suddenly the large ant heads his way, he falls down the stairs as the giant ant breaks out of the house]",ant_man
gale,That’s a messed-up looking dog.,ant_man
darren cross,[back inside Cassie’s room; to Scott] I’m going to destroy everything you love! [Paxton shows up],ant_man

paxton,"You stay behind me, okay?",ant_man
cassie lang,Okay.,ant_man
paxton,Behind me. [Scott looks up at Cross’ particle pack],ant_man
Scott Lang,"I’m gonna have to shrink between the molecules to get in there. [to Cross] Get away from us! Daddy, help! [Scott jumps up to head towards Cross’ particle pack] I love you, Cassie. [Scott shrinks to a small enough size to break into Cross’ particle pack, this causes Cross and Scott to go subatomic and disappear]",ant_man
cassie lang,"Daddy, where are you? [Scott floats past dust, viruses, molecules, atoms, hadrons, quarks, and finally the deepest parts of gluons and remembers Pym’s words]",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,[voice] Go sub-atomic… go sub-atomic… [Scott tries to grow himself back to normal size but realized he can’t],ant_man
Scott Lang,"Oh, no. [he continues to float in the quantum realm]",ant_man
Dr. Hank Pym,"[voice] You would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant. And as you shrink for all eternity, everything that you know and love gone forever. [Scott hears Cassie’s voice echoing as he floats in the quantum realm]",ant_man

Scott Lang,Cassie.,ant_man

Happy Hogan,"Yeah, nice.",iron_man_3
aldrich killian,Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its DNA.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,It would be incredible.,iron_man_3
aldrich killian,Mm.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable. As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not...",iron_man_3
aldrich killian,"Tony. Tony. You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago, he turned me down. But something tells me now there is a new genius on the throne who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore, and who has slightly less of an ego.",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"It's gonna be a no, Aldrich. As much as I'd like to help you.",iron_man_3
aldrich killian,"Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed. But then as my father used to say, 'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,That's very deep.,iron_man_3
aldrich killian,Mm,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,And I have no idea what it means.,iron_man_3
aldrich killian,"Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.",iron_man_3
aldrich killian,"I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Happy...,iron_man_3
Happy Hogan,"The car is ready, if you're ready to go.",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Yes. I just um...God, I forgot my other thing, so I'm just gonna...",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,I'm sorry I'm late. I was... What the...? What is that?!,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"You're wearing this in the house now? What is that, like Mark 15?",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Yes, I did. I...I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present. Is it gonna fit through the door?",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall.",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Okay.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"So, uh...tense? Good day?",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Ooh shoulders, a little naughty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Did I like it?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Nailed it, right?",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Wow. I appreciate the thought very much.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the...",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Uh-huh.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,The facial slit?,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Crowbar. Yeah.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak.",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,I'll take my chances.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,That's risky.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Busted.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,This is a new level of lame.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Sorry.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"You ate without me, already? On date night?",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,[referring to Mark 42 suit] He was just...,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,You mean you?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work.",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Uh-huh.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,What?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,What?,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Happy was concerned.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"No, you're spying on me.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,I wasn't...,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,I'm going to bed.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Hold on. Come on. Pep.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Nothing's been the same since New York.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you. My suits, they're uh...",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Machines.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,But they're part of me.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,A distraction.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Maybe.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,I'm gonna take a shower.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Okay.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,And you're gonna join me.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Better.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony...,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Power down!,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Don't go, alright? Pepper?",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.,iron_man_3
savin,Can you regulate?,iron_man_3
taggert,"Yes, I can regulate.",iron_man_3
savin,Are you sure about that?,iron_man_3
taggert,Yes.,iron_man_3
savin,It's a decent batch. Don't say I never did nothin' for you.,iron_man_3
taggert,Thank you...I mean for understanding.,iron_man_3
Happy Hogan,"I'm sorry, buddy.",iron_man_3
savin,"What are you doin', buddy? You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?",iron_man_3
Happy Hogan,"Yeah, a little movie called ""The Party's Over"", starring you and your junkie girlfriend, and here's the ticket. [Hogan shows him what he took from Taggert's suitcase]",iron_man_3
savin,"No kidding? That doesn't belong to you. [Savin goes to take the item from Hogan's hand, but Hogan punches Savin in the face, Hogan notices Savin's face glow red and heal, then Savin grabs hold of Hogan and with super strength throws him aside, as Savin walks towards Hogan, Taggert begins to glow red and turn super hot]",iron_man_3
taggert,Savin!,iron_man_3
savin,What?,iron_man_3
taggert,"Help! Help me! [Taggert suddenly explodes, causing a massive explosion inside the theater which wounds Hogan, as he lies injured, Hogan sees Savin, also glowing red and then healing and walking off as if nothing has happened] [we see another TV footage from The Mandarin]",iron_man_3
the mandarin,"True story about fortune cookies. They look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off, The Chinese Theater. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the big one is coming; your graduation. [as Hogan lies in hospital critically injured, Tony is sat in his room when a nurse walks in to check on Hogan]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Hi.,iron_man_3
Happy Hogan,Oh.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,[referring to the TV] Uh...mind leaving that on?,iron_man_3
Happy Hogan,Sure. [Tony rises from his seat],iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant. [he pauses for a moment] One more thing...make sure everyone wears their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't let anyone in without them. [Tony turns to leave] [news reporters are all waiting for Tony outside the hospital]",iron_man_3
hospital news reporter,We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark. We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...his reaction to the latest attack. [Tony walks out and all the reporters swarm toward him] Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark! Our sources are telling us that this is another Mandarin attack. Anything else you can tell us? [Tony ignores the questions and walks toward his car],iron_man_3
pushy tabloid reporter,"Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'. [Tony turns to face the reporter]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"10880, Malibu Port, 90265. I'll leave the door unlocked. [to the reporter] Bill me. [Tony gets in his car and drives off] [as Tony is working his lab]",iron_man_3
jarvis,"I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction. [Tony starts looking at all the data gathered]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning ""adviser to the King"". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater. [Tony pushes the virtual information down to close] Close. [Tony looks at the virtual crime scene reconstruction]",iron_man_3
jarvis,The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.,iron_man_3
jarvis,"No, sir.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Talk to me, Happy. [in the virtual reconstruction, Tony sees Hogan pointing his finger at some dog tags] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] Any military victims?",iron_man_3
jarvis,"Not according to public records, sir.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees.",iron_man_3
jarvis,The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack. [Tony looks at the information popping up] Nope. [he sees an attack in Rose Hill, Tennessee] That. You sure that's not one of his?",iron_man_3
jarvis,It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Bring it around.,iron_man_3
jarvis,The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius. [Tony looks at all the information being presented on the Tennessee attack],iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?",iron_man_3
jarvis,"Creating a flight plan for Tennessee. [as Tony is about to get ready to leave for Tennessee, he hears his door bell ring]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Are we still at ""ding-dong""? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?",iron_man_3
jarvis,"There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address. [we see Maya standing outside Tony's house, the glass doors are opened and she enters]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Right there's fine. [Tony dressed in his Iron Man suit walks toward her] You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?",iron_man_3
maya hansen,You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast.",iron_man_3
jarvis,"Gluten-free waffles, sir.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,That's right.,iron_man_3
maya hansen,"Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship. [as he turns to walk into the living room, two bags are thrown down from the above balcony] It's...with her.",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Tony, is somebody there? [Tony steps out of his suit]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Yeah, it's Maya Hansen. Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely. [as Pepper starts walking downstairs, Tony moves towards Maya and speaks quietly] Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.",iron_man_3
maya hansen,"He's thirteen. And no, I need your help.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,What...what for? Why now?,iron_man_3
maya hansen,"Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,I'll be fine.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,We weren't.,iron_man_3
maya hansen,"No, I...",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,And old girlfriends!,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,She's not really.,iron_man_3
maya hansen,"No, not really. It...it was just one night.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Yep.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,It was a great night.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Well, you know...",iron_man_3
maya hansen,Yeah.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,You have saved yourself a world of pain.,iron_man_3
maya hansen,I'm sure.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,What?,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Trust me. [to Tony] We're going out of town.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Okay, we've been through this. Nope.",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Yep!,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,The man says no.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Immediately and indefinitely!,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Honey...,iron_man_3
maya hansen,Great idea. Let's go. I'll...,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Tony, this is how normal people behave.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,I can't protect you out there. I challenged... [Maya notices giant stuffed rabbit Tony had bought for Pepper],iron_man_3
maya hansen,Is...is that normal?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Yes, this is normal!",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Sadly, that...is very normal.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"It's a big bunny, relax about it!",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Calm down!,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,I got this for you.,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,I'm aware of that.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,You still haven't even told me that you liked it!,iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,I don't like it!,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"I asked you three... You don't like it?! [as Tony and Pepper are bickering, Maya notices on the TV that helicopters are coming toward Tony's home]",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Tony, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,I said no.,iron_man_3
maya hansen,"Guys, can we um...",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,What?,iron_man_3
maya hansen,"[she points to the bomb heading straight for the house, the house is suddenly hit, as everything explodes around them, Tony manages to get his Iron Man suit onto Pepper to protect her from the fall, Tony looks over to Maya, who's lying unconscious on the ground, as the ceiling is about to fall on Tony, Pepper saves him with the Iron Man suit] Do we need to worry about that?",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,I got you.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here. [the helicopters starts shooting at the house] Move! I'm right behind! [as they run to get out, the floor in front of Tony collapses, Pepper manages to get on the other side] Get her, I'm gonna find a way around. [Pepper hesitates] Stop stopping! Get her, get outside! Go! [Pepper manages to grab Maya and use the Iron Man suit to get them safely out of the house, but the house gets further destroyed as the helicopters continue to fire on it]",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Oh my God. Tony! [back inside as the house is being destroyed around Tony],iron_man_3
jarvis,"Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure. [Tony motions for his Iron Man suit to come off Pepper and onto him]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Jarvis, where's my flight power?!",iron_man_3
jarvis,"Working on it, sir. This is a prototype. [Tony manages to use his suit to destroy one of the helicopters]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,That's one.,iron_man_3
jarvis,"Sir, the suit is not combat-ready. [Tony manages to get away from the bullets being fired at him from one of the remaining helicopters and again uses his suit to bring down the helicopter]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"That's two. [as the helicopter explodes it crashes into the house, the remaining helicopter continues on shooting at the house, finally the remains of house with Tony inside fall into the ocean, Pepper runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down into the ocean] Tony! [in the water, Tony starts to feel like he's drowning]",iron_man_3
jarvis,"Sir, take a deep breath. [after a few moments Tony's suit gets its flight power activated by Jarvis] Flight power restored. [finally Tony manages to fly out of the ocean [inside the suit Jarvis tries to wake Tony] Sir. Sir!",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Alright, kill the alarm. I got it.",iron_man_3
jarvis,"That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent. [Tony notices that he's flying through the snow at night, he falls and crashes into the ground in the middle of a forest, he takes off his face helmet as he lies on the ground catching his breath]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?",iron_man_3
jarvis,"We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta...",iron_man_3
jarvis,I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Who asked you? Open the suit.,iron_man_3
jarvis,"I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Open eject. [the suit gets off Tony and he sits up] That's brisk! [as Tony starts to feel the cold weather] Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.,iron_man_3
jarvis,"I actually think I need to sleep now, sir. [the suit loses power]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy. [Tony drags the suit to a petrol station and makes a call to Pepper]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian. [Tony drags the suit to an abandoned looking farmhouse, he places the suit on a couch and sits next to it] Let's get you comfy. [he places its hand by its side] You happy now? [as Tony tries to fix the micro-repeater implants in his arm a boy stands by the doorway and points his toy gun at Tony]",iron_man_3
harley keener,Freeze! Don't move.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS. [the boy points his gun at a glass on a shelf and shoots at it, breaking the glass] And now you're out of ammo.",iron_man_3
harley keener,What's that thing on your chest?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here.",iron_man_3
harley keener,What does it power? [Tony stands and points the desk light at his suit sitting on the couch behind him] Oh my God! [Harley drops his toy gun and takes a step towards Tony] That...that's... Is that Iron Man?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Technically, I am.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,A valid point.,iron_man_3
harley keener,[referring to the suit as he sits next to it on the couch checking it out] What happened to him?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him.",iron_man_3
harley keener,Like a mechanic?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Yeah.,iron_man_3
harley keener,Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine...,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,It's Iron Patriot now.,iron_man_3
harley keener,That's way cooler!,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"No, it's not.",iron_man_3
harley keener,"Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Retroreflective panels?,iron_man_3
harley keener,To make him stealth mode.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,You want a stealth mode?,iron_man_3
harley keener,"Cool, right?",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.,iron_man_3
harley keener,"[as he touches the suit, Harley accidentally snaps off one of its fingers] Oops!",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.",iron_man_3
harley keener,Sorry.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?",iron_man_3
harley keener,"Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich.",iron_man_3
harley keener,What's in it for me?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Salvation. What's his name?,iron_man_3
harley keener,Who?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?",iron_man_3
harley keener,How'd you know that?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"I got just the thing. [he opens a compartment on the suit and takes out a metal object] This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face, press the button on top. It discourages bullying. Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass. [Harley reaches out to take it, but Tony pulls his hand away] Deal? Deal? What'd you say?",iron_man_3
harley keener,Deal.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Deal? [Tony gives the object to Harley] What's you're name?,iron_man_3
harley keener,Harley. And you're...,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"The mechanic. Tony [Tony looks at Harley for a moment] You know what keeps going through my head? Where's my sandwich? back at Tony's house, which is now surrounded by emergency rescue and news reporters, Pepper stands alone and looks at one of Tony's shattered Iron Man helmets, she notices a red flashing light inside the helmet and as she puts the helmet on she receives the message Tony had left her earlier] Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. [later that night as Pepper drives Maya home]",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,Why were you at the house tonight? What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?,iron_man_3
maya hansen,"I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin. So if you still want to talk about it, I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think? But Tony says you're a botanist, so...",iron_man_3
maya hansen,"That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of forty out of a privately-funded think tank, but sure you can call me a botanist.",iron_man_3
Pepper Potts,"This boss of yours, does he have a name?",iron_man_3
maya hansen,"Yeah, Aldrich Killian. [Pepper looks at her in shock] [we see Aldrich talking on the phone to Savin]",iron_man_3
savin,"Well, we took the house down, sir...",iron_man_3
aldrich killian,Mmhmm.,iron_man_3
savin,But there's no sign of a body.,iron_man_3
aldrich killian,I see.,iron_man_3
savin,No Stark.,iron_man_3
aldrich killian,"I have to go. [Aldrich rises from his seat walks towards another room] The Master is about to record and he's a little... Well, you know how he gets. Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done. [Aldrich walks into a room which has been set up as a set with all of Mandarin's props in place and camera crew ready to record Mandarin's message] Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact, unless you wanna get shot in the face. [we then see the Mandarin arrive with his entourage and enter the house]",iron_man_3
mandarin look-out,"The Master is traveling. [the Mandarin arrives on set and takes a sit, he looks at Aldrich]",iron_man_3
the mandarin,"Well then, what are we waiting for? [in Rose Hills, Tennessee, Tony and Harley walk in town at night]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that. [he pulls his sleeve up and we see he's wearing a little girl's pink watch, Harley laughs]",iron_man_3
harley keener,"She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Maybe never, relax about it.",iron_man_3
harley keener,"What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space. [they stop and Tony looks at the remains of the local explosion site that Tony came to investigate] What's the official story here? What happened?",iron_man_3
harley keener,"I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here. [Tony looks around at the remains]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Six people died, right?",iron_man_3
harley keener,Yeah.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Including Chad Davis?,iron_man_3
harley keener,Yeah. [Tony keeps looking around at the remains of the explosion site],iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Yeah. That doesn't make sense. [he sits next to Harley] Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.",iron_man_3
harley keener,"Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five.",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,Do you buy that?,iron_man_3
harley keener,That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,No idea. I'm not...I don't care.,iron_man_3
harley keener,"That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?",iron_man_3

harley keener,Does this subject make you...make you edgy?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?",iron_man_3

Tony Stark,I don't think so.,iron_man_3

Tony Stark,"Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out! [Tony, looking agitated, suddenly rises] Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?",iron_man_3
harley keener,"What did I say? [Tony starts running off and Harley runs after him] Hey, wait up! Wait, wait. [Tony stops running and Harley catches up with him] What the hell was that? [Tony holds his face in his hands for a moment and then throws some snow at Harley]",iron_man_3

harley keener,Where she always is.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"See, now you're being helpful. [later we see Tony walking towards a bar and he bumps into a woman] Sorry. [the woman drops something] Lady, this uh... [he picks up the item and hands it back to the woman]",iron_man_3

Tony Stark,"Nice haircut, suits you.",iron_man_3
brandt,Nice watch.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Yeah, limited edition.",iron_man_3

Tony Stark,"Mrs. Davis, mind if I join you?",iron_man_3
mrs. davis,Free country.,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"It sure is. [Tony sits next to her, Mrs. Davis looks at Tony for a moment]",iron_man_3
mrs. davis,Alright. Where'd you like to start?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.,iron_man_3
mrs. davis,"Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go. [she drops the file in front of him] Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it. [Tony opens the file]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?",iron_man_3
mrs. davis,Yeah. [Tony looks at the file again and notices a photo of Taggart next to the photo of Chad],iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.",iron_man_3
mrs. davis,What?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,As a weapon.,iron_man_3
mrs. davis,"You're not the person who called me after all, are you? [suddenly a cell phone is slammed on their table]",iron_man_3
brandt,"Actually, I am. [Tony looks up and it's the woman he bumped into outsid the bar] [suddenly Brandt grabs hold of Tony's arm and twists it, slamming his head onto the table, Tony manages to quickly grab hold of Chad's dog tags that were on the table]",iron_man_3
rose hills sheriff,"Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about? What the hell's going on here?",iron_man_3
brandt,"It's called an arrest. [she pushes Tony to the ground and steps towards the Sheriff] Sheriff, is it?",iron_man_3
rose hills sheriff,"Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?",iron_man_3
brandt,Homeland Security. [she holds up her badge] We good here?,iron_man_3
rose hills sheriff,"No, we're not good. I need a little more information than that.",iron_man_3
brandt,"Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.",iron_man_3
rose hills sheriff,"Yeah, well, why don't you get on the horn to Nashville and uh...upgrade me? [Tony gestures to Mrs. Davis to hide the file, she pushes it under the bar]",iron_man_3
brandt,"Alright, you know what? I was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh...the fun way's always good. [Tony notices her hand turning red hot, burning the badge in her hand]",iron_man_3
rose hills sheriff,"Deputy, get this woman and... [suddenly Brandt shoves the hot badge into the Sheriff's face, she takes his gun and shoots him, Tony runs out of the bar and Brandt follows him, he turns to her]",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go. [as Tony turns to run again he sees Savin getting out of a car and walk towards him, as Savin gets his gun out to shoot at him, Tony runs off and Harley throws something at Savin to make him miss Tony, Tony stops behind a car and sees a man hiding low on the ground] Crazy, huh?",iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Watch this. [Tony smashes into the window of a shop] [as Tony and Brandt are fighting in the shop, Tony starts a fire in shop] You walked right into this one, I've dated hotter chicks than you. [Tony puts Chad's dog tags into the microwave and he turns on the gas]",iron_man_3
brandt,That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?,iron_man_3
Tony Stark,"Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography. [Tony quickly leaves through the back door, as the dog tags heat up in the microwave they start sparking up fire, Brandt realizes the gas has been left on and suddenly the shop explodes killing Brandt] [Tony finds the Savin has grabbed Harley]",iron_man_3
harley keener,Let me go! [Savin mocks Harley],iron_man_3
savin,"Help me! Help me! [as Tony's leg is trapped under some rubble, Savin sits in front of him with Harley sat on his lap] Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?",iron_man_3

EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.",thor

A HELPFUL ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor. Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the Attendant quickly backs away. From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS.

Odin,"Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace. So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace. Responsibility, duty, honor. These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire.

Sif,I fear we'll live to regret this.,thor
volstagg,If we're lucky.,thor
Thor,We must first find a way to get past Heimdall.,thor

Thor,"Then tell no one where we've gone until we've returned. Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles him.",thor
volstagg,What happened? Your silver tongue turn to lead?,thor
Loki,Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth. Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.,thor
Heimdall,"Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. You'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim.",thor
Thor,I have no plans to die today.,thor
Heimdall,"None do. Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the apparatus of the Observatory starts up.",thor
Heimdall,All is ready. You may pass.,thor
volstagg,Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?,thor
Heimdall,To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.,thor
volstagg,"Ah. Never mind, then. Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others, grins.",thor
Thor,"Come on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost.

hogun,We shouldn't be here.,thor
Thor,Too late now.,thor
fandral,"Actually, it's not. We could turn right around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire. Could be nice. Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.",thor
Loki,Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother.,thor
Thor,For what?,thor
Loki,To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.,thor
volstagg,"I'm liking that. Gauging, surveying. Particularly the distance part.",thor
Thor,"We know all we must. It's time to act. Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.",thor

Thor,What would you call it?,thor

volstagg,Starving.,thor
Sif,Whining.,thor
Thor,How about a song to lift our spirits? The others groan.,thor

Sif,"Well, now I'm on board. She and Thor share a grin. The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a central plaza.",thor
Sif,Where are they?,thor
Thor,Hiding. As cowards always do. Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza. Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.,thor
jotun sentry,"What is your business here, Asgardian? The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.",thor
Thor,I speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers.,thor
jotun voice,"Then speak. Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple, where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and his people have endured.",thor
laufey,"I am Laufey, King of this Realm.",thor
Thor,And I am--,thor
laufey,"We know who you are, Odinson. Why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world?",thor
Thor,"I demand answers. Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.",thor
laufey,"You ""demand?""",thor
Thor,How did your people get into Asgard?,thor
laufey,"The house of Odin is full of traitors. Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed by the Jotun King's words.",thor
Thor,Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies.,thor
laufey,"Your father is a murderer and a thief. He stole what was ours, and left our world in ruins. We have the right to reclaim the Casket.",thor
Thor,"Not when you'd use it to make war against other Realms. Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.",thor
laufey,"And why have you come here? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it. I see you for what you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man.",thor
Thor,"This boy has grown tired of your mockery. Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores him.",thor
Loki,"Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered.",thor
Thor,"Know your place, brother...",thor
laufey,You should listen to his counsel. You know not what your actions would unleash. Laufey steps out of the shadows.,thor
laufey,"But I do. Go now, while I still allow it. Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.",thor
Loki,"We will accept your most gracious offer. The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant nearby mutters under his breath.",thor
jotun,"Run back home, little princess. Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's coming.",thor
Loki,"Damn. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor. Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.",thor
volstagg,"Silly hammer! Has a mind of its own! ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR around them, extending off the ends of their arms like SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.",thor
fandral,"I'm hoping that's just decorative. Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost Giant. His comrades form another circle around him, separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying this.",thor
Thor,Next! Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.,thor
fandral,"Well? What move, do you think?",thor
volstagg,"I say we use ""The Norn's Revenge.""",thor
fandral,"At this close range? I think ""The Alfheim Lunge"" is a better move.",thor
hogun,"Shut up! Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle. A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun with his mace. Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.",thor
Sif,"If you don't treat me like a lady, I won't act like a lady! She takes out the Jotun. Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable, swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him. The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.",thor
Loki,"Pathetic. He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at once. Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE. The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back. Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.",thor
Thor,"Come on! At least make it a challenge for me! He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor rises, grins.",thor
Thor,"Now that's more like it! He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute head over heels. Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies back to his grasp.",thor
Thor,"Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the ground by another. It raises its weapon above her. Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest. The Jotun falls dead.",thor
Sif,"I'm so glad I taught him how to do that! Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good hits in.",thor
volstagg,"You may want to put some ice on that! The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind. Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.",thor
volstagg,"You may be taller, but I'm wider! Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him flying. Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and sending him crashing to the ground.",thor
volstagg,"It's not too late for you to surrender. Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.",thor
volstagg,"Don't let them grab hold of you! He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the battle. Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword stops mid ice layer. The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face, and the warrior drops to one knee. Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.",thor
volstagg,"Thank you, my lady. But I nearly had him!",thor
Sif,"Of course you did. Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them out.",thor
volstagg,"Hang on! Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously close to hacking into Hogun's legs.",thor
hogun,Watch the legs!,thor
fandral,You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel? Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade away.,thor
fandral,"Fair enough. Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's sword and snaps it in half.",thor
fandral,"Could we stop just a moment while I get another sword? Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant through with his own weapon. The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air, forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral, rendering him helpless.",thor
them off.,Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.,thor
volstagg,That's unfortunate. He hurries to his wounded comrade.,thor
fandral,"I may need a bit of help. Not a good look, is it?",thor
volstagg,Just try not to bleed.,thor
fandral,How's the face?,thor
volstagg,"Flawless. Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice stalagmite. Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost Giants. The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm. Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused. The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the distraction, KICKS the Giant.",thor
Thor,"Come on! But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet.",thor
Loki,That can't be good.,thor
volstagg,"Yes, it could! Might be an early spring! They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle. Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.",thor
Loki,"Thor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle.",thor
Thor,Then go!,thor
Sif,There are too many of them!,thor
Thor,I can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them.,thor
Sif,"Thor! But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.",thor
volstagg,"Run! Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give chase. Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them. The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a",thor
Thor,"Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns. He opens his hand, beckoning. One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground with all his might. KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.",thor
volstagg,What's Thor done?,thor
Loki,"Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them. The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below. Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades.",thor
Thor,"Loki, we have to see. Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating. But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too many, even for a Thunder God.",thor
Odin,"Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.",thor
Odin,Laufey. End this.,thor
laufey,Your boy sought this out.,thor
Odin,"You're right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can stop this before there's further bloodshed. Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice blade at the end of his arm.",thor
laufey,"We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather. He'll get what he came for -- war and death. Odin looks grim, determined.",thor
Odin,"So be it. Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet. The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the fleeing Jotuns with delight.",thor
Thor,Now! We'll finish them together!,thor
Odin,"Silence! Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent. Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.",thor
Thor,Why did you bring us back?,thor
Odin,Do you realize what you've done? What you've started?,thor
Thor,I was protecting my home.,thor
Odin,You cannot protect your friends. How can you hope to protect a kingdom? Odin turns to the others.,thor
Thor,There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act! Odin stares at him.,thor
Thor,"Whatever the cost, the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt.",thor
Odin,"That's pride and vanity that talks! Not leadership! Have you forgotten everything I've taught you? What of a warrior's patience, cunning?",thor
Thor,"While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us! The old ways are done. You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls!",thor
Odin,"You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!",thor
Thor,"And you are an old man and a fool! The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words.",thor
Odin,"A fool, yes! I was a fool to think you were ready. Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.",thor
father--,Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his tracks.,thor
Odin,"Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war. The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor. Odin turns angrily to his son.",thor
Odin,You are unworthy of this Realm... Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.,thor
Odin,...unworthy of your title... He rips away Thor's cloak.,thor
Odin,...unworthy of the loved ones you've betrayed. I hereby take from you your powers. Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand.,thor
Odin,"In the name of my father... A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor, disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the chest piece.",thor
Odin,"...and of his father before... Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor, including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor.",thor
Odin,I cast you out! Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and disappears in the vortex.,thor
darcy,I think that was legally your fault.,thor
jane,Get the first aid kit.,thor
Thor,"Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him, concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful.",thor
darcy,Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR.,thor
jane,"Uh, thanks. Are you okay? Thor searches the ground.",thor
Thor,Hammer...,thor
darcy,"Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. That's pretty obvious. Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines her flashlight down at the sand.",thor
jane,"Erik... look at this. He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look. Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them away.",thor
jane,We've got to move fast before anything changes.,thor
jane,"We need soil samples, light readings, everything. She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at Thor, who stares up at the sky.",thor
selvig,"Jane, we need get him to a hospital. Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the cannister.",thor
jane,Not right now. It'll take too long. County's an hour away. We'll drop him off after we're done here. Selvig looks uncertain.,thor
Thor,Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge!,thor
jane,"Okay, you and Darcy take him to the hospital, I'll stay here.",thor
selvig,"You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert? Thor turns to the others, frustrated.",thor
Thor,You! What world is this? The group is intimidated by his fervor.,thor
selvig,"It's all right, my friend. We're going to get you some help. Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows agitated, belligerent.",thor
Thor,"Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it. Jane looks on, concerned.",thor
jane,"Erik, just back away...",thor
selvig,You're in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo.,thor
Thor,What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?,thor
darcy,"Uh... New Mexico? Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon, unsure what to make of it.",thor
Thor,You dare threaten Thor with so puny,thor
a--,"Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser, ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked.",thor
darcy,What? He was freaking me out.,thor
admissions nurse,Name?,thor
jane,"He said it was ""Thor."" The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.",thor
jane,I've never met him before.,thor
darcy,Until she hit him with the car.,thor
jane,"Grazed him, actually.",thor
jane,"I told you, I don't know him. I just want to make sure he's okay.",thor
admissions nurse,I'm going to need a name and contact number.,thor
jane,Jane Foster.,thor
selvig,"Oh, for God's sake... He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his business card.",thor
selvig,"Here. Let's go. Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.",thor
nurse,"Hi. Just taking a little blood. Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.",thor
Thor,How dare you attack the son of Odin!,thor
nurse,"I need some help! Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.",thor
nurse,We're trying to help you!,thor
Thor,"Then bring me a healing stone, you savages! He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying, furniture overturned.",thor
orderly,"What the hell is this guy on? Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered by this small group. The NURSE injects him with a sedative.",thor
Thor,"You're no match for the Mighty-- Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.",thor
townie,Huh.,thor
townie,Huh.,thor
jane,"Darcy, when you're done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology. Remind him, he owes me.",thor
selvig,We might want to perform a spectral analysis.,thor
jane,"""We?""",thor
selvig,"I flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful. This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up, inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a rack-mounted server.",thor
jane,You know what would be really useful? Do you still have that friend at LIGO?,thor
selvig,She was more than a friend.,thor
jane,Could you call in a favor?,thor
selvig,You don't think this was just a magnetic storm?,thor
jane,"If I'm right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night's event.",thor
selvig,Meaning? Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.,thor
jane,Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger.,thor
selvig,"How ""big"" are we talking about? Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and covered with stars.",thor
jane,I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.,thor
darcy,A what?,thor
selvig,I thought you were a science major.,thor
darcy,Political Science. Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.,thor
jane,She was the only applicant.,thor
jane,"Erik, look...",thor
jane,What do you see here?,thor
selvig,Stars.,thor
jane,"Yes. But not our stars. She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her excitement.",thor
jane,"This is the star alignment for our quadrant, this time of year. So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... those are someone else's constellations. Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself. Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the image catches her eye.",thor
darcy,"Hey, check it out. Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.",thor
selvig,Is that...?,thor
jane,"I think I left something at the hospital. As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape of a MAN.",thor
frigga,How could you have done this?,thor
Odin,Do you understand what he set in motion? He's taken us to the brink of war!,thor
frigga,But banishment? You would lose him forever? He's your son!,thor
Odin,What would you have done?,thor
frigga,"I would not have exiled him to a world of mortals, stripped of his powers, to suffer alone. I would not have had the heart for such cruelty!",thor
Odin,That is why I'm King.,thor
frigga,You can bring him back.,thor
Odin,No. His fate is in his own hands now.,thor
Thor,"It's not possible. He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands slips free from its restraint.",thor
admissions nurse,"I'm sorry, only relatives can visit patients.",thor
admissions nurse,I thought you said you didn't know him.,thor
jane,"I meant I barely know him anymore. The man he's become. He's changed. I mean, what woman really knows her husband, anyway?",thor
admissions nurse,"None of us, dear. He's in Room",thor
jane,Typical. I just lost my most important piece of evidence.,thor
darcy,So now what?,thor
jane,We find him.,thor
selvig,Did you see what he did in there? I don't know if finding him is the best idea.,thor
jane,"I want to know what that thing was, and he may have the answers. We don't have a choice.",thor
darcy,Oo-kay. She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.,thor
selvig,So we're just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him?,thor
jane,"However long it takes. Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --",thor
bam!,"She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.",thor
jane,I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing that on purpose.,thor
Thor,"Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it?",thor
darcy,I think you may have hit him with the car one time too many.,thor
volstagg,We should never have let him go.,thor
Sif,There was no stopping him.,thor
fandral,"At least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.",thor
volstagg,How did the guard even know? Loki stares at his arm.,thor
Loki,I told him.,thor
fandral,What?,thor
Loki,I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long.,thor
volstagg,You told the guard?,thor
Loki,I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.,thor
Sif,"Loki, you're the only one who can help Thor now. You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind!",thor
Loki,"And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous. You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King? The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.",thor
Sif,"He may speak about the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor.",thor
volstagg,"True, but we should be grateful to him. He did save our lives.",thor
hogun,Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin. The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.,thor
fandral,"Why is it every time you choose to speak, it has to be something dark and ominous?",thor
hogun,"A master of magic could easily bring three Jotuns into Asgard. The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.",thor
volstagg,No! Surely not!,thor
fandral,"Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely.",thor
Sif,Who else could elude Heimdall's gaze with tricks of light and shadow?,thor
volstagg,The ceremony was interrupted just before Thor was named King.,thor
Sif,We should go to the Allfather.,thor
fandral,"And tell him what? ""Oh, by the way, we think your son just betrayed the throne. And do us a favor. Bring back Thor. There's a good fellow!""",thor
Sif,"It's our duty. If any of our suspicions are right, then all of Asgard is in danger.",thor
Odin,"Stop! Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it. Odin eyes Loki with dismay.",thor
Loki,Am I cursed?,thor
Odin,"No. Put the Casket down. Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his father.",thor
Loki,What am I?,thor
Odin,You're my son.,thor
Loki,"What more than that? Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened. Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.",thor
Loki,"The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it? Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.",thor
Odin,No.,thor
Loki,Laufey's son... He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.,thor
Loki,Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?,thor
Odin,You were an innocent child.,thor
Loki,"You took me for a purpose, what was it? Odin doesn't answer.",thor
Loki,Tell me!,thor
Odin,"I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day, bring about an alliance, bring about a permanent peace... through you. But those plans no longer matter.",thor
Loki,"So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me.",thor
Odin,Why do you twist my words?,thor
Loki,You could have told me what I was from the beginning. Why didn't you?,thor
Odin,You are my son. My blood. I wanted only to protect you from the truth.,thor
Loki,Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?,thor
Odin,Don't...,thor
Loki,It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.,thor
Odin,Listen...,thor
Loki,"Because no matter how much you claim to ""love"" me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard! Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries to fight it off.",thor
Odin,Listen to me! Loki strides away towards the exit.,thor
Odin,"Loki! Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional, and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll. The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving trails behind him as he staggers backwards. Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a scream. He collapses to the stone floor. Loki, shocked, hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms, calls out.",thor
Loki,Guards!,thor
cell phones.,"They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge. An EAGER TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain from the back of the truck. He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.",thor
eager townie,This'll do it. He yells to the driver.,thor
eager townie,"Okay, let 'er rip! The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then STRAINS, its wheels spinning futilely, until finally the rear of the truck, along with the back wheels and axles, break off and go flying. People dive out of the way. The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN ""THE MAN"" LEE. He looks back, shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party continuing. They don't notice as --",thor
crater.,He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- MJOLNIR. He pulls out a phone.,thor
darcy,"You know, for a crazy homeless guy, he's pretty cut. Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a t-shirt.",thor
darcy,"Hey, sorry I tased you! Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the equipment there with interest. Jane hurries over to put a stop to it.",thor
jane,My ex. Thor stares at her a beat.,thor
jane,They're the only clothes I had that'll fit you. Sorry.,thor
Thor,They will suffice. Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on the wall.,thor
jane,You're welcome. Now tell me... Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to his form in the Bifrost photo.,thor
jane,"What were you doing, in that? He glances at it, dismissive.",thor
Thor,"What does anyone do in the Bifrost? Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word. Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within the book, curious.",thor
selvig,"The Bifrost... Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the book.",thor
jane,What exactly is the Bifrost?,thor
jane,Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.,thor
frigga,I asked him to be honest with you from the beginning. There should be no secrets in a family.,thor
Loki,So why did he lie?,thor
frigga,"He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different. You are in every way our son, Loki, and we your family. You must know that. Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.",thor
Loki,How long will it last?,thor
frigga,I don't know. This time is different. We were unprepared.,thor
Loki,I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.,thor
frigga,"But he's put it off for so long now, I fear... Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her eyes.",thor
frigga,"You're a good son. Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he really feels.",thor
frigga,"We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us. And your brother. Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.",thor
Loki,What hope is there for Thor?,thor
frigga,"There's always a purpose to everything your father does. Thor may yet find a way home. Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS hurriedly approaching.",thor
frigga,"Thor is banished. The line of succession falls to you. Until he awakens, Asgard is yours.",thor
frigga,"Make your father proud. Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the feel of it in his hand.",thor
jane,"Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night. Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets flustered, looks away.",thor
jane,Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud.,thor
darcy,And how you could eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry. Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of coffee.,thor
Thor,This drink. I like it.,thor
darcy,"Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Isabela makes the best coffee in town. Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.",thor
jane,"Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.",thor
jane,What was that? He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.,thor
Thor,It was delicious. I want another.,thor
jane,Then you should just say so!,thor
Thor,I just did.,thor
jane,I mean ask for it. Nicely.,thor
Thor,I meant no disrespect.,thor
jane,"All right, then no more smashing, deal?",thor
Thor,You have my word.,thor
jane,Good.,thor
isabela,"Morning, Pete. Jake.",thor
townie pete,"The usual, please, Izzy. Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.",thor
isabela,"What crater? Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the Townies with interest.",thor
townie pete,They're saying some kind of satellite crashed in the desert.,thor
jane,"Excuse me, did you say there was a satellite crash?",thor
darcy,"Oh my God, this is going on Facebook. Darcy whips out her cellphone.",thor
selvig,What did the satellite look like?,thor
Thor,Where?!,thor
pete,I wouldn't bother! Looked like the whole Army was coming in when we left!,thor
jane,Where are you going?,thor
Thor,Twelve miles east of here. He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks with him.,thor
jane,Why?,thor
Thor,To get what belongs to me.,thor
jane,So now you own a satellite?,thor
Thor,It's not what they say it is.,thor
jane,"Whatever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs. You intend to just walk in there and take it?",thor
Thor,Yes. He stops walking.,thor
Thor,"If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know.",thor
jane,Everything?,thor
Thor,"All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Darcy looks to the others.",thor
darcy,"""Myeu-muh?"" What's ""Myeu-muh?"" Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,",thor
selvig,Jane. He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much care for him.,thor
jane,You know what we saw last night. This can't be a coincidence. I want to know what's in that crater.,thor
selvig,I'm not talking about the crater. I'm talking about him.,thor
jane,He's promised us answers.,thor
selvig,"He's delusional! Listen to what he's saying! ""Thor."" ""Bifrost."" ""Mjolnir."" These are the stories I grew up with as a child!",thor
jane,"I'd just be driving him out there, that's all.",thor
selvig,It's dangerous. He's dangerous.,thor
jane,I'm sorry. I can't take you.,thor
Thor,I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye. He takes her hand and kisses it.,thor
jane,That's... thank you. Thor bows slightly to each of them.,thor
Thor,Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.,thor
selvig,Now... let's get back to the lab. We have work to do. Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor as he walks away down the street.,thor
Sif,"Allfather, we must speak with you",thor
urgently--,"But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see --",thor
Loki,"Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand. Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.",thor
volstagg,What is this?,thor
Loki,My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard.,thor
fandral,Where is Odin?,thor
Loki,Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again.,thor
Sif,We would speak with her. Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.,thor
Loki,"She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your ""urgent"" matter to me, your King. Sif covers quickly.",thor
Sif,We would ask you to end Thor's banishment.,thor
Loki,"My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of this.",thor
Loki,"All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard.",thor
fandral,Of course. Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki stares after them.,thor
jane,Hey! That's my stuff!,thor
jane,What the hell is going on here?! The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.,thor
Phil Coulson,"Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with",thor
shield.,"Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows wary.",thor
jane,"I don't care who you work for, you can't do this!",thor
selvig,Jane. This is more serious than you realize. Let it go.,thor
jane,Let it go?! This is my life!,thor
Phil Coulson,We're here investigating a security threat. We need to appropriate your equipment and all your atmospheric data.,thor
jane,"By ""appropriate"" you mean ""steal?"" Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.",thor
Phil Coulson,This should more than compensate you for your trouble. She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.,thor
jane,I can't just pick up replacements from RadioShack! I made most of that equipment myself!,thor
Phil Coulson,Then I'm sure you can do it again.,thor
jane,And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!,thor
Phil Coulson,"We're the good guys, Ms. Foster. He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is fully herself, fueled by outrage.",thor
jane,So are we! We're on the verge of,thor
understanding something,extraordinary. Jane holds up her notebook.,thor
jane,"Everything I know about this phenomenon is in this lab and in this book, and no one has the right to take it from me. Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's carrying. Jane is stunned.",thor
Phil Coulson,Thank you for your cooperation. He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.,thor
jane,"Years of research, gone.",thor
darcy,They even took my iPod.,thor
selvig,And your back-ups?,thor
jane,Look around! They took our back- ups. They took the back-ups of our back-ups.,thor
darcy,"I just downloaded, like, thirty songs on there.",thor
selvig,"No one knows much about them. But I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up, and he was never heard from again.",thor
jane,I'm not going to let them do this. I'm getting everything back.,thor
selvig,"Please, let me contact one of my colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some dealings with these people. I'll e- mail him and see if he can help.",thor
darcy,"They took your laptop, too. Annoyed, Selvig thinks.",thor
selvig,I'll just be a minute. He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street and sees something that intrigues her.,thor
Thor,I need a horse.,thor
Thor,"Then give me one of those, large enough to ride. The Pet Store Clerk looks confused. Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door. Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer.",thor
jane,You still want a lift?,thor
librarian,"Joshua, come sit down. It's story time. The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --",thor

jane,I've never done anything like this before! Have you ever done anything like this before? Thor looks amused by her excitement.,thor
Thor,Many times. You're brave to do it.,thor
jane,They just stole my entire life's work. I really don't have anything left to lose.,thor
Thor,But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm.,thor
jane,"""This Realm?"" Why do you talk like that?",thor
Thor,"You think me e? Jane laughs, catches herself.",thor
jane,Yeah. Just a little.,thor
Thor,Good e or bad strange?,thor
jane,"I'm not quite sure yet. She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.",thor
jane,"Sorry. She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.",thor
jane,Who are you? Really?,thor
Thor,You'll see soon enough.,thor
jane,You promised me answers.,thor

Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the center of it all -- Mjolnir.",thor
jane,"That isn't a satellite crash. They would have hauled the wreckage away, not built a city around it. Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.",thor

As more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by. Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main entrance tube to the center of the site. A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight right on him. Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact. He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing the ATV's spotlight. Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off the wheel to protect himself. The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it.

Loki,"Father is dead. Thor stares at him, stunned.",thor
Thor,What?,thor
Loki,"Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear. The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him, looks in his eyes, consolingly.",thor

Loki,"Hello, Father. Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal. Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.",thor
laufey,"Ah, the bastard son. I thought Odin had killed you. That's what I would have done. He's as weak as you are.",thor
Loki,"No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens. Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me. This gives Laufey pause.",thor
laufey,Or perhaps it was the wisest choice I've ever made. I will hear you.,thor
Loki,"I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies. I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket. Laufey studies Loki's face.",thor
laufey,Why would you do this?,thor
Loki,"When all is done, we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds. Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could.",thor
laufey,This is a great day for Jotunheim. Asgard is finally ours.,thor
Loki,"No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told. Laufey considers the proposition.",thor
laufey,"I accept. Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a smile crosses his face.",thor
Loki,"What troubles you, Gatekeeper?",thor
Heimdall,"I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see nor hear you. You were shrouded from me, like the Frost Giants who entered this Realm.",thor
Loki,Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.,thor
Heimdall,"Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see. Loki sizes him up, smiles.",thor
Loki,"You have great power, Heimdall. Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?",thor
Heimdall,No.,thor
Loki,And why is that?,thor
Heimdall,"Because he is my King, and I am sworn to obey him.",thor
Loki,Exactly. Just as you're sworn to obey me now. Yes? A beat.,thor
Heimdall,Yes.,thor
Loki,Good. Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started. Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after him.,thor

Thor,Thank you for what you've done.,thor

Thor,Are you in love with her?,thor
selvig,"Of course not! Jane's like a daughter to me. Her father and I taught at University together. A good man, but he never listened. This registers with Thor.",thor
Thor,Neither did I. Selvig eyes him with interest.,thor
selvig,"I don't know if you're really delusional, and I really don't care at this point. I just care about her. I've seen the way she looks at you.",thor
Thor,"I swear to you, I mean her no harm.",thor
selvig,"Good. If that's the case, then I'll buy you one more drink, and you'll leave town tonight. A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.",thor
Thor,I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong. Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than he's seen before.,thor
selvig,"It's not a bad thing, finding out that you don't have all the answers. That's when you start asking the right questions. Thor takes this in.",thor
Thor,"For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.",thor

drunk townie,I wouldn't mind her doing a little research on me. He laughs. Thor is annoyed.,thor
Thor,I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful.,thor
drunk townie,"And you should shut the hell up, princess. Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's baiting.",thor
Thor,I will not fight him.,thor
drunk townie,"Then it'll be easy to kick your ass. Selvig stands, steps between the two men.",thor

Thor,He's fine. Not injured at all.,thor
Thor,"Sorry, my friend.",thor

Thor,We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud.,thor

selvig,I still don't believe you're the God of Thunder.,thor
Thor,These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her.,thor
jane,"Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never... Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from him, puts it away.",thor
jane,Can we go outside?,thor
jane,I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy.,thor
jane,I'm glad you're safe.,thor
Thor,You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve.,thor
jane,"I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out. He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her",thor
jane,"I don't believe it... She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.",thor
Thor,It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry.,thor
jane,"No, this is good. Thank you. This means I don't have to start from scratch... She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.",thor
Thor,What's wrong?,thor
jane,"SHIELD, whatever they are. They're never going to let this research see the light of day.",thor
Thor,You must do this. You must finish what you've started.,thor
jane,Why?,thor
Thor,Because you're right. It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point. You're nearly there. You just need someone to show you how close you really are.,thor
Thor,"Look -- your ancestors called it magic. You call it science. I come from a place where they're one and the same thing. We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.",thor
jane,What is it?,thor
Thor,This is how my father explained it to me...,thor
fandral,"Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, yet you manage to consume four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef, and two casks of ale. Shame on you! Don't you care?! Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg pulls his weapon, stopping him.",thor
volstagg,Do not mistake my appetite for apathy.,thor
Sif,"Stop it, both of you! We all know what we have to do, we're just too damned afraid to do it!",thor
fandral,"It's treason, Hogun.",thor
volstagg,"To hell with treason, it's suicide.",thor
fandral,"Yes, yes, we know!",thor
Sif,Thor would do the same for us. An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.,thor
einherjar guard,Heimdall demands your presence. Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.,thor
volstagg,We're doomed.,thor
selvig,I need some coffee. The three head inside Smith Motors.,thor
darcy,Thanks.,thor
Thor,"You're very welcome. Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates. She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their breakfast, looking like a little family.",thor
agent garrett,They want an update.,thor
agent cale,Tell them he's eating eggs.,thor
agent garrett,Scrambled or fried? Cale glares at him.,thor
darcy,Sure.,thor
Thor,Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Thor leaves.,thor
Thor,To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior.,thor
isabel,Okay. Thank you.,thor
Thor,"If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your ""coffee.""",thor
isabel,"Any time. He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and shrugs.",thor
isabel,She could do worse.,thor
volstagg,"Good Heimdall, less us explain--",thor
Heimdall,"You would defy the commands of Loki our King, break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back? The four exchange nervous glances.",thor
Sif,"Yes, but--",thor
Heimdall,Good. The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?,thor
volstagg,So you'll help us?,thor
Heimdall,"I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the Bifrost to you. With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory. The others exchange puzzled looks.",thor
fandral,"Complicated fellow, isn't he?",thor
volstagg,"Now what do we do? Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.",thor
Sif,"Look! The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally. Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.",thor
Phil Coulson,What the hell was that?,thor
techie,"I don't know, sir. We got massive energy readings out of nowhere, then they just disappeared. Fifteen miles due northwest.",thor
Phil Coulson,Let's go take a look.,thor
volstagg,He must have landed nearby. It's time to put our tracking skills to work. Spread out. Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints.,thor
fandral,The winds would have blown them away by now. We should look for signs of a campfire.,thor
Sif,"Or we could just start there. She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.",thor
fandral,"It's worth a look, I suppose. The party tromps towards the town.",thor
volstagg,"There you go, lad! The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head off.",thor
volstagg,"Is it just me, or does Earth look a little different to you?",thor
Sif,It has been a thousand years...,thor
volstagg,"Things change so fast here. You leave for a millennium, and it's like the whole neighborhood's gone. Volstagg sniffs, smells something.",thor
volstagg,Perhaps we should split up.,thor
agent garrett,Is there a Renaissance Faire in town?,thor
agent cale,"Call it in. But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes their heads together. They're out.",thor
volstagg,"Never cared for spies. He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a bite. He likes what he tastes.",thor
volstagg,Exquisite.,thor
einherjar guard,"My liege, the Warriors Three and the Lady Sif have gone missing. Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible.",thor
Heimdall,"Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?",thor
Loki,"You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King.",thor
Heimdall,"Then I need no longer obey you. Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki. Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --",thor
Loki,Ensure my brother does not return.,thor
utensils away.,The door opens.,thor
volstagg,"Found you! Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --",thor
Thor,"My friends! Thor happily races over and greets his comrades. Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder.",thor
selvig,I don't believe it...,thor
darcy,Who are they?,thor
volstagg,"Lady Sif and the Warriors Three. Surely you've heard tales of Hogun the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and I, Volstagg the Svelte? Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.",thor
volstagg,"Well, perhaps I've put on a little more muscle since I was here last.",thor
jane,That would have been a thousand years ago? Northern Europe?,thor
volstagg,"Exactly! Those lovely herring people. They worshipped us! Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.",thor
Thor,"My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come.",thor
fandral,We're here to take you home. Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.,thor
Thor,You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile. The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.,thor
Sif,Thor... your father still lives. Thor reacts to the revelation.,thor
Phil Coulson,"Get somebody from Linguistics out here. Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost storm ROARS in the sky above. Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the desert floor. Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.",thor
darcy,"Was somebody else coming? Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground.",thor
Phil Coulson,I don't think so. But the guy doesn't tell me anything.,thor
Phil Coulson,Hello! You're using unregistered weapons technology. Please identify yourself. We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up inside.,thor
Phil Coulson,"Incoming! As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return fire.",thor
Thor,Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety.,thor
jane,What about you?,thor
Thor,I must stay and fight. The Asgardians look to Thor.,thor
Thor,"I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side.",thor
volstagg,You're but a mortal now. You'll get yourself killed!,thor
fandral,"Or one of us, trying to protect you.",thor
Sif,"The best thing you can do is get the mortals to safety and leave the battle to us. Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the oncoming threat.",thor
Thor,"Help me clear the streets. I'll let none of these people die this day. Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head across town, towards the Destroyer.",thor
Loki,Father. Welcome to Asgard.,thor
the destroyer,"Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from within it. It unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.",thor
Sif,Keep him distracted. She hurries off. The Warriors Three continue towards the behemoth.,thor
fandral,"What do you think? ""The Svartalfheim Twist?"" ""Kiss of the Hag?"" ""Face Full of Boot?"" Volstagg grins eagerly.",thor
volstagg,"""The Flying Mountain."" Hogun and Fandral groan.",thor
fandral,"Not ""The Flying Mountain!"" It threw out my back for a year last time!",thor
volstagg,"Trust me, it'll work.",thor
volstagg,For Asgaaaaard!!!,thor
apologetically.,"The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral, smashing into them, when --",thor
Sif,"Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and plunges it deep into the back of the creature. The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a brief moment of hope. But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation. Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180 degrees to face its attackers. The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor. Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks free, landing in the middle of the street.",thor
jane,"Erik! She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going into shock.",thor
Thor,"Come on... give me one! Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over the end of the iron rod.",thor
jane,"What are you doing? What is that? As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it. Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound completely. Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed flesh.",thor
selvig,I'm really starting to like him. Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.,thor
Thor,"Go, while you can!",thor
Sif,But the others...,thor
Thor,You can't help them now. Your job is to survive. She struggles to sit up.,thor
Sif,No! I will die a warrior's death. Stories will be told of this day-- He gently takes her shield from her.,thor
Thor,"Live and tell those stories yourself. At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious, with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way towards them. Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun and Fandral.",thor
fandral,No. We can still fight!,thor
Thor,"But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die! Thor looks at them, grins.",thor
Thor,"Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan. The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and drag him away from the battlefield. After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then tosses Sif's shield aside. He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely defenseless.",thor
Thor,"Brother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents. He continues towards the Destroyer.",thor
Thor,"Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard.",thor
selvig,"Jane, no! He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead, watching the scene --",thor
krakakaboom!,"A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --",thor
jane,Oh. My. God.,thor
krakaboom!,"Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale force winds. Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.",thor
Drax,"Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate. The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES within him, firing out of all his openings. Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever. Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the skies, around the Destroyer, burying it. Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him. A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.",thor
Phil Coulson,Donald... I don't think you've been completely honest with me.,thor
darcy,"So, how can you speak our language?",thor
volstagg,"Your language? Ha! Silly girl, you're speaking ours. Thor calls up to the sky.",thor
Thor,Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!,thor
Thor,He would open it if he could. I fear the worst.,thor
volstagg,Then we're trapped here forever.,thor
fandral,"Then I suppose we'd best start settling into our new lives. He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.",thor
fandral,Are all earth maidens as fair as you? Darcy enjoys the attention.,thor
darcy,No. Thor shouts back up to the sky.,thor
Thor,Heimdall!,thor
volstagg,"Primitive. Good enough for hunting small game, I suppose. Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.",thor
fandral,"Sorry, my love. These things happen.",thor
Thor,"Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world. From this day forward, count me as your ally.",thor
Phil Coulson,Not stolen. Borrowed. Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.,thor
Phil Coulson,"You'll get your equipment back. You're going to need it to continue your research... which, after today's events, SHIELD would like to fully sponsor. If that's all right with you. Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him again.",thor
Thor,"Whatever fate lies before me, you are part of it. He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.",thor
Thor,Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me.,thor
the moment.,He forms an ICE BLADE.,thor
laufey,"It's said you can still see and hear what transpires around you, even in this state. I hope it's true, so that you may know your death came by the hand of Laufey. He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --",thor
Loki,And your death came by the son of Odin.,thor
frigga,"Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She looks to Loki, takes him in her arms.",thor
Loki,"I swear to you, mother, they will pay for what they've done today. I will end the Jotun threat, now and forever! He looks to Odin.",thor
Loki,"And I will make you proud. Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.",thor
frigga,"Thor! She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.",thor
Loki,"Found its way back to you, did it?",thor
Thor,No thanks to you. Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.,thor
frigga,What?,thor
Thor,"Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends? To kill me? Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.",thor
Loki,It must have been enforcing Father's last command.,thor
Thor,"You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been.",thor
Thor,Jotunheim...,thor
Loki,"All these years, and no one's ever dared to use it as a weapon. Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor, blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the ice as Thor staggers to his feet.",thor
Loki,You can't stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.,thor
Thor,Why have you done this?,thor
Loki,"To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done.",thor
Thor,He won't! You can't kill an entire race!,thor
Loki,"What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands.",thor
Thor,I've changed.,thor
Loki,So have I. Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.,thor
Loki,"Fight me. He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow, but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back towards the frozen controls. Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended.",thor
Thor,Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become?,thor
Loki,I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me!,thor
Thor,"I will not fight you, brother.",thor
Loki,I am not your brother. I never was.,thor
Thor,"Loki, this is madness... Loki grins.",thor
Loki,"Is it? He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to his feet.",thor
Loki,"What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was a woman. Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.",thor
Loki,"It was. Perhaps when we're finished here I'll pay her a little visit myself. That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.",thor
selvig,Jane?,thor
jane,Something's wrong.,thor
hand.,"The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim. Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too powerful. Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides towards the Bifrost.",thor
Loki,"If you care so much for the Jotuns, then die with them. The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand towards the Bifrost. MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand. The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his brother.",thor
Loki,"Thor! Help me! Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking up at him desperately.",thor
Loki,"Please... Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir. Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls him across the bridge.",thor
Loki,I was always more clever than you.,thor
Thor,"Yet still not clever enough. With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air, summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the Lokis. All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir knocked from his grasp. Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps away. Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's pinned to the ground. Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to do. Loki watches him smugly.",thor
Loki,"Look at you, the Mighty Thor. With all your strength, what good does it do you now? Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet, VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea. He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice. Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.",thor
Loki,"Stop! What are you doing?! Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM! The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream out from it. Loki thinks fast.",thor
Loki,"If you destroy the Bridge, you'll never see her again! Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor through the back.",thor
Thor,"Forgive me. Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow -- KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING out of it. Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes. The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART. As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the broken Bridge. They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized by the debris, when --",thor
Odin,"Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the Odinsleep, restored to his full strength. Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is disappointment and regret. Loki lets go.",thor
Thor,"No! But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the Observatory, disappearing out of sight. Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back into his father's arms.",thor
Odin,It is over.,thor
jane,It's gone.,thor
volstagg,"...and then, with a mighty bellow, I flew at the great metal beast and laid it low...",thor
fandral,Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a--,thor
volstagg,"As a matter of fact, falling down was a tactic. Lulling the Destroyer into a false sense of security!",thor
fandral,"Well, I was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield. That makes me the real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun? Hogun points to Volstagg.",thor
hogun,Big stomach.  Big mouth. The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a smile.,thor
fandral,"Well, how about that? A smile! I'd say that calls for another drink! They laugh and raise another round. Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches Frigga, bows her head.",thor
Sif,My Queen. I am so sorry for your loss. Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.,thor
frigga,"Thank you, Sif. She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around him.",thor
frigga,How is he?,thor
Sif,He mourns for his brother. And he misses her. The mortal. Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.,thor
frigga,He will need his friends now more than ever.,thor
Sif,"I will always be at his side. Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.",thor
Odin,You'll be a wise King.,thor
Thor,There will never be a wiser king than you. Or a better father.,thor
Odin,"You've already made me proud. Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.",thor
Thor,"Can you see her? Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.",thor
Heimdall,Yes.,thor
Thor,How is she?,thor
the-art equipment.,"Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE before her, which bears the ""STARK INDUSTRIES"" logo. From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.",thor

jane,Thanks. Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.,thor
darcy,He would have come back if he could.,thor

dr. abraham erskine,Just one? [he sits down facing Steve],captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers,Why me?,captain_america_first_avenger
dr. abraham erskine,"I suppose that is the only question that matters. [He looks down at the bottle of schnapps he brought with him.] This is from Augsburg. My city. So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi’s invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the… my people struggled. They… they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the… and the… [he waves his hand] And he… he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, ""You."" He says, ""You will make us strong."" Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of HYDRA, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he’s ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist.",captain_america_first_avenger
dr. abraham erskine,Schmidt must become that superior man.,captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers,Did it make him stronger?,captain_america_first_avenger
dr. abraham erskine,"Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.",captain_america_first_avenger
Steve Rogers,Thanks. I think.,captain_america_first_avenger

yon-rogg,Skrull ambush. I thought we'd lost you. Did you find Soh-Larr?,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,"It wasn't Soh-Larr. Talos simmed him, even knew his code.",captain_marvel
yon-rogg,That's impossible. That code was buried in his unconscious.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,"The Skrulls messed with my mind. The machine that they used, I think it was how they extracted Soh-Larr's code.",captain_marvel
yon-rogg,"Vers, where are you?",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,I'm on planet C-53. The Skrulls are looking for someone named Lawson.,captain_marvel
yon-rogg,Who?,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,She's... who I see...,captain_marvel
yon-rogg,"She's what? Vers. Vers, what?",captain_marvel

Nick Fury,Vers. Star Force. How long are you planning on being in town?,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,"Oh, I'll be out of your hair as soon as I track down the Skrulls which are infiltrating your planet.",captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Skrulls?,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,"Shape-shifters. They can transform into any lifeform down to the DNA. Oh boy, you guys don't have a clue do you.",captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hold on. How do we know that you're not one of those... shapeshifters?",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Congratulations Agent Fury. You have finally asked a relevant question.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Oh! Congratulations to you Star Force Lady. You're under arrest.,captain_marvel

Nick Fury,"Well, I'd say fine. But it can't believe what it's seeing.",captain_marvel

Nick Fury,Talked like him too.,captain_marvel

Nick Fury,The word she used was infiltration.,captain_marvel
director,Belive her?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Not 'till I say this.,captain_marvel
director,What's your plan?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"I got to find Blockbuster girl. I got word on a motorcycle thief which fits her description. She can tell us why these lizards are here, maybe she can tell us how to kick them to the curb.",captain_marvel
director,Good. Do it alone though. Can't trust anyone. Not even our own men.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Yes sir.,captain_marvel
director,"Wow, they're ugly bastards aren't they?",captain_marvel
medical examiner,"Yeah, well. They're not Brad Pitt sir.",captain_marvel

bartender,What can I get ya?,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Where was this photograph taken?,captain_marvel
bartender,At an airport?,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Where's Pegasus?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,That's classified. Not unlike the file I started on you.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,But I see you changed it up a bit since then. Grunge is a good look for you.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Did you have a rough day Agent Fury?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"It's cool. You know, space invasion, big car chase, got to watch an alien autopsy. Typical 9 to 5.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,So you saw one?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,I was never one to believe in aliens. But I can't unsee that.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,This is gonna get a little awkward but I gotta ask.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,You think I'm one of those green things.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Can't be too careful.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,You are looking at 100 percent red-blooded Earthman.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,We talking cheek swab or urine sample.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,No. The DNA would match.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Well my AOL password.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Skrulls can only assume recent memories of their host bodies.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Oh oh! You wanna get personal.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Where were you born?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Huntsville, Alabama. But technically I don't remember that part.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Name of your first pet.,captain_marvel

Carol Danvers,And then?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Spy.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Where?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"It was the Cold War, we were everywhere. Uh... Belfast, Bucharest, Belgrade, Budapest.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Now?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Been riding a desk for the past few years, trying to figure out where our future enemies are coming from. Never occurred to me that they'd be coming from above.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Name a detail so bizarre a Skrull could never fabricate it.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"If toast is cut diagonally, I can't eat it. You didn't need that did you?",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,"No. No, I didn't. But I enjoyed it.",captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Ok. Your turn. Prove your not a Skrull,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,And how is that supposed to prove to me that your not a Skrull?,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,It's a photon blast.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,And...?,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,A Skrull can't do that. So a full-bred colonel turned spy turned SHIELD agent must have pretty high-security clearance. Wheres Pegasus?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"So the Skrulls are alien races which infiltrate and overtake alien planets. And you're a Kree, a race of noble warriors.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,So um. What do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson?,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,They believe she developed a light speed engine at Pegasus.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Light speed engine? I've got to admit, that's not the craziest thing I've heard today.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,"Well, it's still early.",captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"And you, what do you want?",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,To stop the Skrulls before they become unstoppable.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"And...? Look, war is a universal language. I know a rogue soldier when I see one, you've got a personal stake in this.",captain_marvel
security checkpoint,"This is a government property, turn your vehicle around.",captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Nicholas Joseph Fury, Agent of SHIELD.",captain_marvel
security checkpoint,Place your thumb on the pad. One moment.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,"Nicholas Joseph Fury, you have three names?",captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Everybody calls me Fury. Not Nicholas, not Joseph, not Nick. Just Fury.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,What does your mom call you?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Fury.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,What do you call her?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Fury.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,What about your kids?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"If I have them, they'll call me Fury.",captain_marvel
security checkpoint,You're cleared for access.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Thank you.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Oh, hold up. You look like somebody's disaffected niece. Put that on.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,What is this? [gesturing towards the logo],captain_marvel
Nick Fury,It's the SHIELD logo.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Does announcing your identity on clothing help with the covert part of your job.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Said the space soldier who was wearing a rubber suit.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Lose the flannel.,captain_marvel
security,How can I help you?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,We're agents of SHIELD.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,We're looking for a woman named Lawson.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,A Dr. Wendy Lawson.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Do you know her?,captain_marvel
security,Follow me.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Hmm.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Are you familiar with the phrase ""Welcome Wagon""?",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,No.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Well, this ain't it.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Is that a communicator?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Yeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Who are you paging?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"My mom. Don't worry, I didn't mention you.",captain_marvel
Nick Fury,After you.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Impressive.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Oh. You should see what I can do with a paperclip.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Hey, there. How are you?",captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Oh my goodness. Look at you. Just look at you. Aren't you the cutest little thing.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Aren't you cute? And what's your name, huh? What's your name? ""Goose"", cool name for a cool cat.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Fury.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,I'll be back.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Oh. Let me get my fingerprint out. Just let me unravel this puppy.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,You sat there and watched me play with tape? When all you had to do was... [Fury imitates Carol shooting the energy],captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,I didn't want to steal your thunder.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Huh. Lawson.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Ha. Lawson's plan for the light-speed engine. I wonder why they terminated the project.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Um, maybe because she's cuckoo.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Kreeglyphs?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Hmm?,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Lawson is not cuckoo. She's Kree.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Well, she's dead.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,What?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"She crashed the ASIS aircraft during an unauthorized test flight. Took a pilot down with her. That's why security here's so unfriendly. They're covering up a billion dollar mistake. Oh, and your light-speed engine is toast.",captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,When did this crash happen?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Six years ago. 1989.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Who was the pilot?,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,"Um, most of this thing's redacted but there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau. Last person to see them both alive.",captain_marvel
Nick Fury,You OK?,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,Mm-hmm.,captain_marvel
Nick Fury,Back in a minute.,captain_marvel
lawson,This isn't about fighting wars. It's about ending them.,captain_marvel
Carol Danvers,I know Lawson was Kree. She was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash. Do you know anything about this?,captain_marvel
yon-rogg,"I just discovered a mission report sent from C-53. There's only so much I'm cleared to tell you Vers, but... Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell. She was working on a unique energy core. Experimenting with tech that apparently could help us win the war.",captain_marvel

Sam Wilson,"It's your bed, right?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,What's that?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,"Your bed, it's too soft. When I was over there I'd sleep on the ground and use rock for pillows, like a caveman. Now I'm home, lying in my bed, and it's like...",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Lying on a marshmallow. Feel like I'm gonna sink right to the floor.,captain_america_winter_soldier

Sam Wilson,"Two tours. You must miss the good old days, huh?",captain_america_winter_soldier

Steve Rogers,You're damn right.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"You just can't stop yourself from lying, can you?",captain_america_winter_soldier

Steve Rogers,Neighbor.,captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"Ah, Captain. I'm Alexander Pierce.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Sir, it's an honor. [they shake hands]",captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"The honor is mine, Captain. My father served in the 101st. Come on in. [they enter Pierce's office where he shows Steve an old photo of Fury with Pierce] That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met. When I was at State Department in Bogota. ELN rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages. Nick was deputy chief for the SHIELD station there. And he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building through the sewers. I said, ""No, we'll negotiate."" Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order. They stormed the basement, and what did they find? They find it empty. Nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil. He saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,So you gave him a promotion.,captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"I've never had any cause to regret it. Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,I don't know.,captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,You know it was bugged?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"I did, because Nick told me.",captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it? [Steve doesn't reply obviously not knowing this information] I want you to see something. [he brings up footage of Batroc being interrogated],captain_america_winter_soldier
shield agent,"Who hired you, Batroc?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Is that live?,captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Are you saying he's a suspect? Assassination isn't Batroc's line.,captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"No, it's more complicated than that. Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star and he was contacted by e-mail and paid by wire transfer. And then the money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts, the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Am I supposed to know who that is? [he hands Steve the file],captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,Not likely. Veech died six years ago. His last address was 14-35 Elmhurst Drive. When I first met Nick his mother lived at 14-37.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why?,captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,If you really knew Nick Fury you'd know that's not true.,captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"Why do you think we're talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists. We knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, that to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down. And that makes enemies. Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today, makes me really, really angry. [he hesitates a moment] Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive. I don't think that's an accident, and I don't think you do either. So I'm gonna ask again, why was he there?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,He told me not to trust anyone.,captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,I wonder if that included him. [Steve pauses a moment before replying],captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"I'm sorry. Those were his last words. Excuse me. [Steve picks up his shield, places it on his back and starts to make his out of the office]",captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"Captain. [Steve stops and looks at Pierce] Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why. Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it. Anyone.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Understood. [Steve turns and leaves],captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,[after he leaves Pierce's office he steps into the elevator] Operations control.,captain_america_winter_soldier
shield computer,Confirmed. [just as the elevator doors are about to close Rumlow steps in with two STRIKE agents],captain_america_winter_soldier
brock rumlow,Keep all STRIKE personnel on site.,captain_america_winter_soldier
strike agent #1,Understood.,captain_america_winter_soldier
strike agent #2,"Yes, sir.",captain_america_winter_soldier
brock rumlow,Forensics.,captain_america_winter_soldier
shield computer,Confirmed.,captain_america_winter_soldier
brock rumlow,Cap.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Rumlow. [the elevator doors close and they start riding down],captain_america_winter_soldier
brock rumlow,Evidence Response found some fibres on the roof they want us to see. You want me to get the tac-team ready?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"No, lets wait and see what it is first.",captain_america_winter_soldier
brock rumlow,Right. [Steve notices one of the agents touching his weapon suspiciously] [the elevator stops and more SHIELD and STRIKE agents enter],captain_america_winter_soldier
shield agent #1,What's the status so far?,captain_america_winter_soldier
shield agent #2,Administrations level.,captain_america_winter_soldier
shield computer,Confirmed.,captain_america_winter_soldier
shield agent #2,[to Steve] Excuse me.,captain_america_winter_soldier
brock rumlow,"[to Steve] I'm sorry about what happened with Fury. Messed up, what happened to him.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Thank you. [feeling something is off, Steve looks at the agents in the elevator and notices one of them is sweating, then the elevator stops and more agents enter]",captain_america_winter_soldier
strike agent #3,Records.,captain_america_winter_soldier
shield computer,Confirmed. [as the elevator doors close Steve realizes he's been surrounded by agents],captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Before we get started, does anyone want to get out? [there's a moment's pause before suddenly one of the agents turns and uses an electric rod to give Steve a shock, the others grab him and try to strap his wrists with magnetic cuffs, Steve manages to knock some of them down but one cuff remains, then Rumlow uses his rod to give Steve a shock] [as Steve is being attacked we see Sitwell in a controls room watching them from a monitor]",captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,"Mobilize STRIKE units, 25th floor. [Steve manages free himself from the magnetic cuff and knock all the agents down, he turns to Rumlow]",captain_america_winter_soldier
brock rumlow,"Whoa, big guy. I just want you to know, Cap, this ain't personal. [Rumlow then goes to attack Steve with his electric rod but Steve manages to defend himself and eventually knocks Rumlow out]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"It kind of feels personal. [Steve picks up his shield then opens the elevator doors, but he's faced by a team of STRIKE agents pointing their weapons at him]",captain_america_winter_soldier
25th floor strike agent,"Drop the shield! Put your hands in the air! [Steve uses his shield to break off the elevator wires which sends the elevator down, as he forces the doors open he sees more STRIKE agents approaching him, he closes the door and looks for a way out]",captain_america_winter_soldier
strike agent,"Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open! You have nowhere to go! [Steve breaks through the glass in the elevator and plummets down to finally hit the ground floor, from his monitor Sitwell watches in shock as Steve gets up and starts running off]",captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,"Are you kidding me? [ordering the STRIKE team] He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge! [Steve rides out of the SHIELD garage on his motorcycle, evading the obstacles laid out but then a Quinjet emerges ahead of him]",captain_america_winter_soldier
quinjet pilot,"Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down. [the Quinjet lowers its machine gun] Repeat, stand down. [as Steve doesn't stop they start shooting at him, Steve throws his shield into the propellers to jam it, giving him an opportunity to hop onto it and do more damage to the jet with his shield before jumping off as the jet goes crashing down and he escapes]",captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,"[to the SHIELD agents] Eyes here. [everyone, including Agent 13, looks at Sitwell] Whatever your op is, bury it. This is Level One. Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red. Shut all runways at BWI, IAD and Reagan. All security cameras in the city go through this monitor, right here. Scan all open sources. Phones, computers, PDAs, whatever. If someone tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.",captain_america_winter_soldier
sharon carter,"With all due respect, If SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.",captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"Because he lied to us. [Pierce enters the room] Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury, he refused to share it. As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Where is it?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Safe.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Do better!,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Where did you get it?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Why would I tell you?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Fury gave it to you. Why?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,What's on it?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,I don't know.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Stop lying!,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"I only act like I know everything, Rogers.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,I'm not gonna ask you again.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"I know who killed Fury. Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists, the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier. He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,So he's a ghost story.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran, somebody shot out my tires near Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out, but the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me. [she pulls up her shirt to show him the scar on the side of her stomach] Soviet slug, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now. [there's a hit of a smile from Natasha]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried. [Natasha holds up the flash drive] Like you said, he's a ghost story. [Steve takes the flash drive from her]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.",captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood. To any reasonable person, that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.",captain_america_winter_soldier
councilman rockwell,You know what makes him a traitor? Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.,captain_america_winter_soldier
councilman singh,"Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight. A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations. At best, he lied to you. At worst...",captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,Are you calling for my resignation? I've got a pen and paper right here.,captain_america_winter_soldier
councilwoman hawley,That discussion can be tabled for a later time.,captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,But you do want to have a discussion.,captain_america_winter_soldier
councilman rockwell,"We've already had it, Mr. Secretary. This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off. [they go to a Mac store to use one of their computers]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up SHIELD will know exactly where we are.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,How much time do we have?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Uh...about nine minutes from... [she pops the flash drive into a MacBook Pro] Now. [we see several SHIELD vehicles heading their way] Fury was right about that ship, somebody's trying to hide something. This drive is protected by some sort of AI, it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Can you override it?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me. Slightly. [Rumlow and his team pull up outside the mall and head inside] [back at the Mac store, Steve and Natasha continue to try and find out what's on the flash drive] I'm gonna try running a tracer. This is a program that SHIELD developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from.",captain_america_winter_soldier
apple employee,Can I help you guys with anything?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Oh, no. My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Right! We're getting married.,captain_america_winter_soldier
apple employee,Congratulations. Where do you guys thinking about going? [Steve looks at the monitor and sees the signal traced to somewhere in New Jersey],captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,New Jersey.,captain_america_winter_soldier
apple employee,Oh. [the employee looks at Steve for a moment] I have the exact same glasses.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Wow, you two are practically twins.",captain_america_winter_soldier
apple employee,"Yeah, I wish. Specimen. Uh...if you guys need anything, I've been Aaron.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Thank you. [as Rumlow and his team are in the mall looking for Steve and Natasha] You said nine minutes, come on.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Shh, relax. Got it. [they find the signal is coming from Wheaton, NJ] You know it?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"I used to. Let's go. [Steve pulls the flash drive from the computer and they walk out of the store] Standard tac-team. Two behind, to across, two coming straight at us. If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro. [as two agents are coming straight towards them]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Shut up and put your arm around me, laugh at something I said.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,What?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Do it! [Steve quickly puts his arm around Natasha and laughs] [inside the Mac store one of the agents looks around],captain_america_winter_soldier
jack rollins,Negative at the source.,captain_america_winter_soldier
brock rumlow,Give me a floor rundown.,captain_america_winter_soldier
shield agent #2,Negative on three.,captain_america_winter_soldier
shield agent #3,Negative on two.,captain_america_winter_soldier
brock rumlow,"Snake the upper levels, work down to me. [as they are going down the escalator Natasha spots Rumlow on the escalator next to them going up, she turns to Steve]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Kiss me.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,What?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Yes, they do. [she quickly pulls down Steve's head and kisses him making Rumlow look away as he goes past them on the escalator]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,You still uncomfortable?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,It's not exactly the word I would use.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Nazi Germany.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Mm.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,And we're borrowing. Take your feet off the dash. [Natasha takes her feet off the dash],captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Alright, I have a question for you, oh, which you do not have to answer. I feel like if you don't answer it though, you're kind of answering it, you know?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,What?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Was that your first kiss since 1945?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"That bad, huh?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,I didn't say that.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"No, I didn't. I just wondered how much practice you've had.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,You don't need practice.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Everybody needs practice.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"It was not my first kiss since 1945. I'm ninety-five, I'm not dead.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Nobody special, though? [Steve chuckles]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Believe it or not, it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Well, that's alright, you just make something up.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"What, like you?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstances, it's not all things to all people all the time. And neither am I.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,That's a tough way to live.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"It's a good way not to die, though.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone when you don't know who that someone really is.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Yeah. Who do you want me to be?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,How about a friend? [Natasha laughs softly],captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,This is it.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,The file came from these coordinates.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,So did I. [later that night as they walk around the base trying to pinpoint where the signal came from] This camp is where I was trained.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Changed much?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"A little. [Steve has a brief visions of his former, smaller self running past him as he's getting trained with other soldiers]",captain_america_winter_soldier
sergeant duffy,"Pick up the pace, ladies! Let's go! Let's go! Double time! Come on Rogers, move it! [his former self stops and stares at Steve as he is now] Come on! Fall in! Rogers! I said fall in! [present Steve watches nostalgically as the former Steve runs off]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"This is a dead end. Zero heat signature, zero waves, not even radio. Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off. [Steve notices a building ahead of them] What is it? [as they walk over to the building]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Army regulations forbid storing ammunition within five hundred yards of the barracks. This building is in the wrong place. [Steve opens the lock with his shield and they enter inside, when they turn on the lights they notice it's a SHIELD office]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,This is SHIELD.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Maybe where it started. [they enter a room where they find old framed portraits of Howard Stark, Peggy and Col. Chester Phillips]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,There's Stark's father.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Howard.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Who's the girl? [Steve doesn't reply and turns away to walk further down the room and stops by a massive book shelf],captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,If you're already working in a secret office... [he pushes the books shelf and slides open to reveal an elevator behind it] Why do you need to hide the elevator? [they go down the elevator which takes them to a room with old looking computers],captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"This can't be the data-point, this technology is ancient. [suddenly Natasha notices a small flash drive port, she places the flash drive in it which then activates the ancient computer in the room]",captain_america_winter_soldier
computer,Initiate system? [Natasha types using the keyboard],captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Y-E-S, spells yes. [Natasha smiles as the old computer starts to cranks up] ""Shall we play a game?"" [to Steve] It's from a movie that...",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Yeah, I saw it. [suddenly they hear an accented voice speaking]",captain_america_winter_soldier
dr. arnim zola,"Rogers, Steven. Born, 1918. Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna. Born, 1984. [they see an old camera moving above them as it analyzes them]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,It's some kind of a recording.,captain_america_winter_soldier
dr. arnim zola,"I am not a recording, Fräulein. I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945, but I am. [the computer screen shows an old photo of Dr. Arnim Zola]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Do you know this thing?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull. He's been dead for years.,captain_america_winter_soldier
dr. arnim zola,"First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive. In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body, my mind, however, that was worth saving on two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing in my brain.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,How did you get here?,captain_america_winter_soldier
dr. arnim zola,Invited.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value.,captain_america_winter_soldier
dr. arnim zola,They thought I could help their cause. I also helped my own.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,HYDRA died with the Red Skull.,captain_america_winter_soldier
dr. arnim zola,"Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Prove it.,captain_america_winter_soldier
dr. arnim zola,"Accessing archive. [the computer screen shows them old footage of Johann Schmidt/Red Skull, of the how the original SHIELD founders] HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, SHIELD was founded and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD. For seventy years HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war. And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"That's impossible, SHIELD would have stopped you.",captain_america_winter_soldier
dr. arnim zola,"Accidents will happen. [the computer screen shows them HYDRA had killed Howard and Maria Stark making it look like a car accident along with the recent death of Fury] HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA's new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your Life; a zero sum. [in anger Steve suddenly smashes the computer screen] As I was saying...",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,What's on this drive?,captain_america_winter_soldier
dr. arnim zola,Project Insight requires insight. So I wrote an algorithm.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,What kind of algorithm? What does it do?,captain_america_winter_soldier
dr. arnim zola,"The answer to your question is fascinating. Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it. [suddenly the doors starts to close, Steve tries stops it by throwing his shield in between it but he's too late]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Steve, we got a bogey. Short range ballistic. 30 seconds tops.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Who fired it?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,S.H.I.E.L.D.,captain_america_winter_soldier
dr. arnim zola,"I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain. Admit it, it's better this way. We're both of us...out of time. [Steve notices a small opening on the ground, he throws the metal door aside and just as the place explodes he throws himself and Natasha into the hole and protects them with his shield, he then manages to get them out from under the building rubble just as STRIKE agents arrive to roam the area for them]",captain_america_winter_soldier
brock rumlow,[As he notices a footprint in the dust] Call in the asset.,captain_america_winter_soldier
renata,"I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce. You need anything before I leave?",captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"No. Uh...it's fine, Renata, you can go home.",captain_america_winter_soldier
renata,"Okay, night-night.",captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"Good night. [Renata leaves] Want some milk? [the Winter Soldier doesn't reply] The timetable has moved. Our window is limited. Two targets, Level Six. [he pours himself a glass of milk and goes over to join the Winter Soldier at the table] They already cost me Zola. I want confirmed death in ten hours. [just then Renata interrupts them as she enters the kitchen]",captain_america_winter_soldier
renata,"Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...I forgot my phone. [she notices the Winter Soldier]",captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"Oh, Renata. I wish you would have knocked. [Pierce picks up the gun from the table and shoots and kills her]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,"Hey, man.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,I'm sorry about this. We need a place to lay low.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Everyone we know is trying to kill us. [Sam pauses a moment before replying],captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,"Not everyone. [Sam let's them enter, later as Steve and Natasha are cleaning up, Steve notices Natasha looking sad and thoughtful]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,You okay?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Yeah.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,What's going on?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"When I first joined SHIELD, I thought I was going straight. But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA. I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but...I guess I can't tell the difference anymore.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,There's a chance you might be in the wrong business. [Natasha smiles faintly],captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,I owe you.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,It's okay.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life, and you be honest with me, would you trust me to do it?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,I would now. And I'm always honest.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Well, I guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,[to Steve and Natasha] I made breakfast. If you guys...eat that sort of thing. [later as they are sat in Sam's kitchen],captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,who in SHIELD could launch a domestic missile strike?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Pierce.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"But he's not working alone, Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,So was Jasper Sitwell.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap a SHIELD officer in broad daylight?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,you don't. [Sam drops a file in front of Steve],captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,What's this?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,Call it a resume. [Natasha picks up a photo of Sam with his para-rescue team],captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Is this Bakhmala? The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you. [to Steve] You didn't say he was a para-rescue. [looking at the photo of Sam with his colleague]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Is this Riley?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,Yeah.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs. What did you use, a stealth chute?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,"No. These. [he hands Steve the file, Steve opens it and reads it]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,I thought you said you were a pilot.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,I never said pilot.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"I can't ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,"Dude, Captain America needs my help. There's no better reason to get back in.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Where can we get our hands on one of these things?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,"The last one is at Fort Meade, behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall. [Steve looks at Natasha who shrugs her shoulders]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Shouldn't be a problem. [Steve throws down the file on the table and we see that it's a classified military project called Falcon],captain_america_winter_soldier
senator stern,"Listen, I gotta fly home tonight, cause uh...I got some constituency problem, and I gotta press the flesh.",captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,"Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?",captain_america_winter_soldier
senator stern,"Uh...no, not really. Twenty-three, kind of hot. Real hot. You know, wants to be a reporter, I think. I don't know, who listens at that point?",captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.,captain_america_winter_soldier
senator stern,"Really? Cause she's killing my back. Look, this isn't the place to talk about it. [he touches Sitwell's pin on his jacket] This is a nice pin.",captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,Thank you.,captain_america_winter_soldier
senator stern,"Come here. [they embrace and as they do Stern whispers to Sitwell] Hail, HYDRA. [as Stern steps away he touches his back] See, it's right there...",captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,"I just saw that, yeah.",captain_america_winter_soldier
senator stern,Should I get it checked?,captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,"I think you should. [Stern walks away] [Sitwell gets a call from Pierce, Sitwell turns to his men] I need a minute. Bring the car around. [his men leave and Sitwell answers the phone] Yes, sir?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,"Agent Sitwell, how was lunch? I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.",captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,Who is this?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,"The good looking guy in the sunglasses, your ten o'clock. [Sitwell looks around but doesn't see him] Your other ten o'clock. [Sitwell turns the other way and sees Sam sitting a few feet away from him] There you go.",captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,What do you want?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,"You're gonna go around the corner, to your right. There's a grey car, two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride.",captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,And why would I do that?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,"Because that tie looks really expensive, and I'd hate to mess it up. [Sitwell looks down at his tie and sees a small red light from the gun being pointed at him] [Steve throws Sitwell across a rooftop, Natasha follows behind him]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,Tell me about Zola's algorithm.,captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,Never heard of it.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?,captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,"I was throwing up, I get seasick. [Steve forces Sitwell to the edge of the rooftop, Sitwell just smiles] Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof? Because it's really not your style, Rogers.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"You're right. It's not. It's hers. [Steve steps aside and Natasha kicks Sitwell off the roof, he plummets down screaming]",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Oh, wait. What about that girl from accounting, Laura...?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Lillian. Lip piercing, right?",captain_america_winter_soldier
Natasha Romanov,"Yeah, she's cute.",captain_america_winter_soldier

Steve Rogers,The Future? How could it know? [Sitwell laughs],captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,"How could it not? The 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

Steve Rogers,And what then?,captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,"Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,What then?!,captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,Then the Insight Helicarriers scratch people off the list. A few million at a time.,captain_america_winter_soldier
jasper sitwell,[as Sam drives them to Triskelion] HYDRA doesn't like leaks.,captain_america_winter_soldier

dr. arnim zola,"The procedure has already started. [we see the Zola and the Hydra agent amputating his left arm and replacing with the metal arm] You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.

Bucky Barnes,I knew him. [Pierce sits in front of Bucky],captain_america_winter_soldier
alexander pierce,"Your work has been a gift to mankind. You shaped the century, and I need you to do it one more time. Society is at a tipping point between order and chaos.

Natasha Romanov,We have to stop the launch.,captain_america_winter_soldier

Nick Fury,We need to breach those carriers and replace their targeting blades with our own.,captain_america_winter_soldier

Nick Fury,SHIELD had nothing to do with it.,captain_america_winter_soldier

Nick Fury,Why do you think we're meeting in this cave? I noticed.,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,And how many paid the price before you did?,captain_america_winter_soldier
Nick Fury,"Look, I didn't know about Barnes.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"Even if you have, would you have told me? Or would you have compartmentalized that too? SHIELD, HYDRA, it all goes.",captain_america_winter_soldier
Maria Hill,He's right. [Fury looks at Natasha then Sam],captain_america_winter_soldier
Sam Wilson,"Don't look at me. I do what he does, just slower.",captain_america_winter_soldier

Bucky Barnes,I was gonna ask...,captain_america_winter_soldier
Steve Rogers,"I know what you're gonna say, Buck, I just...",captain_america_winter_soldier
Bucky Barnes,"We can put the couch cushions on the floor like when we were kids. It'll be fun. All you gotta do is shine my shoes, maybe take out the trash.

Steve Rogers,"Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.",captain_america_winter_soldier

Steve Rogers,"absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them.

Odin,That's impossible.,thor_dark_world
eir,"The infection, it's defending her.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"No, it's defending itself.",thor_dark_world
Odin,"Come with me. There are relics that predate the universe itself. What lies within her appears to be one of them. The Nine Realms are not eternal. They had a dawn as they will have a dusk. [Odin shows Thor and Jane an ancient book] But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"[reading from the book] ""Born of eternal night, the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light."" They were these stories mother told us as children.",thor_dark_world
Odin,"Their leader, Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness, it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appeared as stones, the Aether is fluid and ever changing. It changes matter into dark matter and seeks out to host bodies, drawing strength from their life force. Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness. But after eternities of blood shed, my father Bor, finally triumphed, ushering in the peace that lasted thousands of years.",thor_dark_world
jane foster,What happened?,thor_dark_world
Odin,He killed them all.,thor_dark_world
Thor,Are you certain? The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them and yet here it is.,thor_dark_world
Odin,The Dark Elves are dead.,thor_dark_world
jane foster,Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?,thor_dark_world
Odin,"No, it does not. [back on Svartalfheim, in his ship Malekith plots his vengeance against the Asgardians]",thor_dark_world
malekith,[subtitled] The Realms will be aligned soon. [Malekith takes out a knife and turns to Algrim],thor_dark_world
malekith,[subtitled] You'll be the last of the Kursed. [Malekith stabs Algrim in the stomach with his knife],thor_dark_world
algrim,[subtitled] Let my life be sacrificed. The same as our people.,thor_dark_world
malekith,"[subtitled] You will become darkness, doomed to this existence until it consumes you. [one of the dark elves places a molten rock in Malekith's hand and Malekith places it inside Algrim's stomach] And then no power of our enemies will stop me.",thor_dark_world
algrim,"[subtitled] I'll destroy their defenses and resurrect the universe. [Malekith looks to one of his dark elves as he carries a mask] [Fandral and Volstagg return to Asgard with several prisoners, including the masked Algrim; Loki watches them from his cell as they come in]",thor_dark_world
Loki,Odin continues to bring me new friends. How thoughtful.,thor_dark_world
frigga,"The books I sent, do they not interest you? [Loki turns and we see Frigga is in Loki's cell]",thor_dark_world
Loki,"Is that how I'm to while away eternity, reading?",thor_dark_world
frigga,"I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.",thor_dark_world
Loki,Have you? Does Odin share your concern? Does Thor? It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night.,thor_dark_world
frigga,You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.,thor_dark_world
Loki,"My actions. I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life, that I was born to be a king.",thor_dark_world
frigga,A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?,thor_dark_world
Loki,A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.,thor_dark_world
frigga,Your father...,thor_dark_world
Loki,[shouts] He's not my father!,thor_dark_world
frigga,Then am I not your mother? [Loki hesitates for a moment],thor_dark_world
Loki,You're not. [Frigga smiles at him with tears in her eyes],thor_dark_world
frigga,"Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself. [she takes a step towards him and extends her hands, Loki goes to touch her hand but his hand goes through hers and we see that she's a hologram, Loki looks at Frigga with sadness and her hologram disappears] [Jane and Thor walk in Asgard]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Well Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth.",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Well, how's that possible?",thor_dark_world
Thor,"I believe you were in between worlds. The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil, orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun. Every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly, we call this the Convergence. [he takes her hand and he shows her by touching his palm to hers] During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred. It's possible you found one of these points. We are lucky that it remained open. Once the worlds pass out of alignment, the connection is lost. [he leans closer and they kiss]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,I liked the way you explained that. What's gonna happen to me?,thor_dark_world
Thor,"I'll find a way to save you, Jane.",thor_dark_world
jane foster,Your father said there was...,thor_dark_world
Thor,My father doesn't know everything. [suddenly they are interrupted by Frigga],thor_dark_world
frigga,Don't let him hear you say that.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"Jane Foster, please meet Frigga, the Queen of Asgard, my mother. [Jane looking embarrassed quickly removes her hand from Thor's mother, Frigga]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Hi. [in his cell, Algrim pulls out the rock that Malekith had placed in his stomach, he crushes it in his hand, transforming himself into a Kursed, he breaks free and releases the other prisoners, Loki watches all this from his cell, then Algrim walks up to Loki's cell and he look at Loki for a moment before turning and walking away]",thor_dark_world
Loki,You might want to take the stairs to the left. [Algrim turns and looks at Loki before walking away again; outside they hear the prison alarm going off],thor_dark_world
frigga,The prisons.,thor_dark_world
Thor,Loki.,thor_dark_world
frigga,"[referring to Jane] Go, I will look after her. [Thor takes off with his hammer; in the prison Volstagg and Fandral enter the fight with the prisoners]",thor_dark_world
fandral,It's as if they resent being imprisoned.,thor_dark_world
volstagg,"There's no pleasing some creatures. [as they continue to fight, Loki is sat calmly in his cell reading, suddenly Thor enters and everyone turns to look at him]",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Return to your cells and further harm will come to you. You have my word. [suddenly one of the prisoners punches him in the face] Very well, you don't have my word. [Thor punches him back and starts fighting with the other prisoners]",thor_dark_world
Odin,"[to his guards] Send a squadron to the weapons vault, defend it at all costs. Seal the dungeon.",thor_dark_world
frigga,Odin.,thor_dark_world
Odin,"Frigga. [to the Asgardian guards] Go! [to Frigga and Jane] It's a skirmish, nothing to fear.",thor_dark_world
frigga,You've never been a very good liar. [at that moment Jane notices Sif as she walks past them],thor_dark_world
Odin,"Take her to you chambers, I'll come for you when it's safe.",thor_dark_world
frigga,You take care.,thor_dark_world
Odin,"Despite all I have survived, my queen still worries over me.",thor_dark_world
frigga,"It's only because I worry over you that you have survived. [Odin goes off, Frigga leads Jane away, she takes a sword from one of the guards] Listen to me now, I need you to do everything I ask and no questions.",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Yes, ma'am. [as Heimdall is stood in his usual guarding post, he suddenly hears something turns and runs out onto the Bifrost Bridge, he jumps onto one of Malekith's ships cloaked in invisibility, making it visible and manages to send it crashing into the sea, but he soon finds that a giant ship is behind him releasing smaller ships to attack Asgard, Heimdall activates a shield to protect Asgard but Algrim manages to deactivate it sending a ship to crash into the palace] [after Malekith's ship has crashed into the palace the Dark Elves start attacking the Asgardian soldiers killing them all, Malekith leaves the ship and goes to look for Frigga and Jane after which Odin arrives to find all the soldiers killed]",thor_dark_world
Odin,Frigga. [Malekith finds the tower where Frigga is hiding Jane and enters the room],thor_dark_world
frigga,"Stand down, creature. You may still survive this.",thor_dark_world
malekith,"I have survived worse, woman.",thor_dark_world
frigga,Who are you?,thor_dark_world
malekith,"I am Malekith, and I would have what it is mine. [as he walks closer to Frigga she strikes him in the face with her sword, he takes out his blade and starts fighting with Frigga, she puts up a good fight but Algrim comes to his aid and subdues her, Malekith walks towards Jane] You have taken something, child. Give it back. [Malekith stands in front of Jane and as he goes to grab her she disappears and he realizes that she's a hologram, he turns to Frigga] Witch! Where is the Aether?",thor_dark_world
frigga,I'll never tell.,thor_dark_world
malekith,"I believe you. [suddenly Algrim stabs Frigga in the back, at the same time Thor rushes in and shoots a lightning bolt at Malekith's face, severely scarring it, he and Algrim escape and jump onto their ship before Thor can catch them; after Malekith and Algrim escape Odin arrives to find Frigga dead, he holds her body in his arms as Thor and Jane look on, a funeral is held for Frigga where all the Asgardians mourn her as her body is pushed out to the sea on a boat and the boat burnt by a flaming arrow, at the same time Loki expresses his grief in his cell] [back on Earth Erik has been institutionalized and is trying to explain the convergence to the patients in his ward]",thor_dark_world
erik selvig,"The universe rotates on a five thousand year cycle, and once its cycled all the worlds align. [he picks up a shoe and holds it up] Imagine...imagine that this is our world, and...and... [one of the patients hands him another shoe] Oh, thank you. And this is another world. Normally they're separate, but during the alignment everything is connected. All Nine Realms, all Nine Realms are passing through each other and gravity, light, and even matter, is crunching from one world to the other. [he demonstrates with the shoes by smacking one on top of the other repeatedly] But if this happens to us now, the result would be cataclysmic. [he then puts the shoes down and picks up two pencils and holds them up] My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence. [he puts the pencil down and picks up the shoes again] This time the alignment, and all the other worlds, would just pass up by. It's beautiful. It's simple. Any questions? [we see the patients in the ward just carrying on with their activity, no one has really taken any notice of him, then one of the patients (Stan Lee) interrupts]",thor_dark_world
patient,Yeah. Can I have my shoe back? [on their ship; to Malekith],thor_dark_world
algrim,"[subtitled] I need your strength to reclaim the Aether. And when you wake up, you will kill them all.[in Asgard, Jane is sat in her room when suddenly the power of the Aether surrounds her and everything around her turns red for a moment, then Volstagg enters the room with two guards]",thor_dark_world
einherjar lieutenant,Jane Foster. You need to come with us. [Fandral and Odin inspect the damage to the palace where Malekith had crashed his ship],thor_dark_world
fandral,"We are still unable to restore the palace shields. Our artillery cannot detect them, even Heimdall cannot see them. My King, we are all but defenseless. [Thor approaches them]",thor_dark_world
Thor,"She's your prisoner now? [to Fandral, Volstagg and the guards] Leave us. [they all start walking off and leave Thor with Odin]",thor_dark_world
Odin,I do not wish to fight with you.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"Nor I with you, but I intend to pursue Malekith.",thor_dark_world
Odin,"We possess the Aether, Malekith will come to us.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Yes, and you will destroy us.",thor_dark_world
Odin,You overestimate the power of these creatures.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"No, I value our peoples lives. I'll take Jane to the Dark World and draw the enemy away from Asgard. When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane it will be exposed vulnerable, and I will destroy it and him.",thor_dark_world
Odin,"If you fail, you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies.",thor_dark_world
Thor,The risk is far greater if we do nothing. His ship could be over our heads right now and we'd never even know it.,thor_dark_world
Odin,"If and when he comes, his men will fall by ten thousand Asgardian blades.",thor_dark_world
Thor,And how of our men shall fall on theirs?,thor_dark_world
Odin,"As many as are needed! [there's a moment pause] We will fight! Until the last Asgardian breath, the last drop of Asgardian blood.",thor_dark_world
Thor,And how are you different from Malekith? [Odin chuckles],thor_dark_world
Odin,"The difference, my son, is that I will win. [Odin turns and walks off] [back on Earth, Darcy paces around her apartment as Ian is sat watching the news on TV]",thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,Jane isn't called me back. Erik isn't calling me back. Stupid SHIELD isn't calling me back!,thor_dark_world
ian boothby,What's SHIELD?,thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,"It's a secret. [Darcy leaves a voice message for Erik] Uh...hey, Erik. It's Darcy again. Uh...Thor came back, he took Jane to Asgard and um...I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.

news reporter,"Something else went missing this week when Astrophysicist, Dr. Erik Selvig, notable for his involvement in the Alien invasion in New York streaked nude across Stonehenge.",thor_dark_world
ian boothby,"Darcy, you really need to look at this. Your friend Erik, what was his last name again? [Darcy looks at the news report on TV]",thor_dark_world
news reporter,"...disrobed and began shouting at visitors at the historic site. He was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation. The police are still refusing to confirm... [Ian presses the pause button on Erik's face from footage taken at Stonehenge, Darcy sits in dismay as she looks at Erik's face on the TV] [in Asgard, Thor is sat alone when Heimdall walks up to him]",thor_dark_world
Thor,You're not in Odin's war council?,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders. No one is to come or to go. [Heimdall takes off his helmet and places it on the table] We face an enemy that is invisible even to me. Of what use is a guardian such as that? [he sits down looking defeated],thor_dark_world
Thor,"Malekith will return, you know this. I'll need your help.",thor_dark_world
Heimdall,"I cannot overrule my King's wishes, not even for you.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"I'm not asking you to. The Realms need their All-Father strong and unchallenged, whether he is or not. But he is blinded, Heimdall, by hatred and by grief.",thor_dark_world
Heimdall,As are we all.,thor_dark_world
Thor,Well I see clearly enough.,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,The risks are too great.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"Everything that we do from here on is a risk, there is no other way. [Heimdall hesitates before replying]",thor_dark_world
Heimdall,What do you require of me?,thor_dark_world
Thor,"What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order. Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death. Malekith knew the Aether was here, he can sense its power. If we do nothing he will come for it again, but this time lay waste to all of Asgard. [we see Thor holding a meeting with Sif, Fandral, Volstagg and Heimdall] We must move Jane off world.",thor_dark_world
Sif,The Bifrost has been shut down and the Tesseract locked away in a vault.,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,"There are other paths off Asgard, ways known only to a few.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"One, actually. [the others suddenly realize he means Loki]",thor_dark_world
volstagg,No. [Thor walks up to Loki's cell where he is standing looking well kept and clean],thor_dark_world
Loki,"Thor, after all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Loki, enough. No more illusions. [suddenly Loki's cell is transformed, the illusion is lifted and we see that Loki's cell is a mess, everything has been thrown around and he's sat on the floor, looking unkempt and messy, in the other corner of the cell]",thor_dark_world
Loki,"Now you see me, brother. [Thor walks up to the other side of the cell to be closer to Loki] Did she suffer?",thor_dark_world
Thor,I did not come here to share our grief. Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.,thor_dark_world
Loki,Go on.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you, vengeance. And afterward, this cell. [Loki chuckles]",thor_dark_world
Loki,You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?,thor_dark_world
Thor,"I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me and I will kill you. [Loki smiles]",thor_dark_world
Loki,Hmm. When do we start? [back to the meeting with Thor and his comrades],thor_dark_world
fandral,He will betray you.,thor_dark_world
Thor,He will try. [Loki and Thor walk out of the Asgardian prison],thor_dark_world
Loki,"This is so unlike you, brother. So clandestine. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?",thor_dark_world
Thor,If you keep speaking I just might.,thor_dark_world
Loki,Fine. As you wish. I'm not even here. [using his diversion tactics Loki turns himself into an Asgardian guard] Is this better?,thor_dark_world
Loki,"Still, we could be less conspicuous. [Loki turns back into himself but turns Thor into Sif] Hm, brother. You look ravishing. [Thor looks down at his body then replies in his own voice]",thor_dark_world
Thor,It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.,thor_dark_world
Loki,"Very well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions, given that you seem to like them so much. [Loki then turns himself into Captain America in his full Captain America costume] Oh, this is much better. Woh. The costume's a bit much, so tight. But the confidence, I can feel the righteousness surging. Hey, you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth, honor, patriotism? God bless Amer– [suddenly Thor grabs hold of Loki puts his hand over his mouth and pushes him against the wall making Loki turn back into himself] What? [Thor looks to the side and they see two Asgardian guards walking away] You could at least furnish me with a weapon. My dagger, something! [Thor looks at him and we hear a noise like a sword being drawn] At last, a little common sense. [Loki then looks down then holds up his hands which now have iron handcuffs on them]",thor_dark_world
Thor,And I thought you liked tricks. [Thor laughs and turns to walk off] [back at the original meeting Thor was holding with his comrades],thor_dark_world
fandral,"Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of our Einherjar who will see you coming from miles away.",thor_dark_world
Thor,I won't be the one who comes for her. [Thor looks over to Sif; then we see Jane is sat in her guarded room when one of the guards enters],thor_dark_world
jane foster,"I'm not hungry. [suddenly Sif comes up behind the guard and knocks him out, she looks over to Jane]",thor_dark_world
Sif,"Good, let's go. [Jane and Sif meet up with Thor with Loki standing beside him, Jane points to Loki]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,You're...,thor_dark_world
Loki,I'm Loki. You may have heard of... [suddenly Jane slaps Loki hard in the face],thor_dark_world
jane foster,That was for New York. [Loki smiles and looks at Thor],thor_dark_world
Loki,I like her. [back at Thor's meeting with his comrades],thor_dark_world
Sif,And what of the All-Father?,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne. [Odin visits Heimdall accompanied by some of his guards],thor_dark_world
Odin,You called me here on an urgent matter. What is it?,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,"Treason, my lord.",thor_dark_world
Odin,Whose?,thor_dark_world
Heimdall,"Mine. [Heimdall draws his sword, at the same time more guards interrupt them]",thor_dark_world
einherjar lieutenant,"My King, the mortal has been taken. [Odin looks at Heimdall as he commands his guards]",thor_dark_world
Odin,"Stop Thor, by any means necessary. [as they hear the guards approaching]",thor_dark_world
guards,There they are! Take them. On my command.,thor_dark_world
Sif,I'll hold them off. Take her.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"Thank you. [Thor and Jane go off, as Loki goes to follow them Sif draws her sword and places it under Loki's throat]",thor_dark_world
Sif,Betray him and I'll kill you. [Loki chuckles],thor_dark_world
Loki,"It's good to see you too, Sif. [Loki leaves to join Thor and Jane as the guards get closer to Sif; back at the original meeting with Thor and his comrades]",thor_dark_world
volstagg,"Assuming you can get Loki's help, and you can free this mortal, what good would it do? We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"That, my friend, is where we won't be leaving by foot. [Thor, Loki and Jane meet Volstagg where Malekith's ship had crashed into the palace]",thor_dark_world
volstagg,I will give you as much time as I can.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"Thank you, my friend. [as they walk towards Malekith's crashed ship, Jane smiles and nods at Volstagg, then as Loki is about to follow Thor and Jane Volstagg stops him]",thor_dark_world
volstagg,If you even think about betraying him...,thor_dark_world
Loki,"You'll kill me? Evidently there will be a line. [Volstagg then lets him pass] [Thor, Jane and Loki board Malekith's crashed ship, Thor looks at the controls and starts pressing some button, looking unsure of what he's doing] I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"I said, ""how hard could it be?"" [meanwhile, the Asgardian guards rush towards the ship with Volstagg standing guard in front of it]",thor_dark_world
guard,They're on the ship!,thor_dark_world
Loki,"They're on the ship! [as they approach the ship Volstagg starts attacking them; back in the ship] Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Shut up, Loki. [outside the ship Volstagg continues to battle with the Asgardian guards; back in the ship Thor continues to frantically press every button to start the ship]",thor_dark_world
Loki,You must have missed something.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing.",thor_dark_world
Loki,"No, don't hit it, just press it gently. [as he hits the buttons]",thor_dark_world
Thor,"I am pressing it gently. It's not working! [suddenly the ship comes to life, Thor laughs; outside the ship Volstagg is overrun by the guards.]",thor_dark_world
guards,Get him! Get him!,thor_dark_world
Loki,I think you missed a column.,thor_dark_world
Thor,Shut up! [finally the ship breaks through the palace walls and takes off] [as they are flying through Asgard],thor_dark_world
Loki,"Look, why don't you let me take over, I'm clearly the better pilot.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Is that right? Well, out of the two of us which one can actually fly? [as they are flying over Asgard suddenly Jane collapses]",thor_dark_world
Loki,"Oh, dear. Is she dead?",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Jane. [Jane raises her head, looking weak]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"I'm okay. [as they continue to fly, the ship hits and breaks off a part of a massive building; to Loki]",thor_dark_world
Thor,Not a word. [several smaller Asgardian ships start following them],thor_dark_world
Loki,Now they're following us. [the smaller ships start firing at them] Now they're firing at us!,thor_dark_world
Thor,"Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki! It's not at all distracting! [the ship then hits a massive stone monument of King Bor, breaking the head off]",thor_dark_world
Loki,"Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather. [the smaller ships continue to follow and fire at them as they fly over Asgard] You know this is wonderful. This is a tremendous idea. Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that. Flying around the city, smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us. It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant! [suddenly Thor pushes Loki off the ship, Thor then picks up Jane and jumps off the flying ship and lands onto a smaller ship being flown by Fandral, Loki has also fallen onto the ship]",thor_dark_world
fandral,"[laughs] I see your time in the dungeons has made you no less graceful, Loki. [the Asgardian ships above them continue to follow and fire at Malekith's ship as they think that Thor is still on there] [Thor lays Jane down]",thor_dark_world
Loki,You lied to me. I'm impressed.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"I'm glad you're pleased. Now, do as you promised. Take us to your secret pathway. [Loki smiles and takes over the ship's control, at the same time the Asgardian ships spot them and start firing at them] Fandral.",thor_dark_world
fandral,"Right. [Fandral picks up a rope and steps on to the edge of the ship] For Asgard. [suddenly he jumps off the ship and uses the rope to swing onto the Asgardian ship following them] Nothing personal, boys! [he knocks out the three guards on the ship then looks over to Thor and salutes him; on Fandral's ship Loki flies them towards the mountains]",thor_dark_world
Thor,Loki!,thor_dark_world
Loki,If it were easy everyone would do it.,thor_dark_world
Thor,Are you mad?,thor_dark_world
Loki,"Possibly. [Thor holds on to Jane, as Loki heads straight for the wall of the mountain, suddenly they enter right through the mountain and then enter through a portal to Svartalfheim] Ta-da! [on their ship, Algrim approaches Malekith]",thor_dark_world
algrim,[subtitled] We must attack now.,thor_dark_world
malekith,"[subtitled] No. Asgard is not important anymore. The Aether has returned home. [as they fly over Svartalfheim, Jane continues to lie down and Thor puts a cover over her]",thor_dark_world
Loki,[sighs] What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.,thor_dark_world
Thor,It would consume you.,thor_dark_world
Loki,"She's holding up alright, for now.",thor_dark_world
Thor,She's strong in ways you'd never even know.,thor_dark_world
Loki,Say goodbye.,thor_dark_world
Thor,Not this day.,thor_dark_world
Loki,"This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing. It's a heart beat. You'll never be ready. The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.",thor_dark_world
Thor,And will that satisfy you?,thor_dark_world
Loki,Satisfaction is not in my nature.,thor_dark_world
Thor,Surrender not in mine.,thor_dark_world
Loki,The son of Odin.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"No, not just of Odin! You think you alone were loved of mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!",thor_dark_world
Loki,Trust. Was that her last expression? Trust? When you let her die!,thor_dark_world
Thor,What help were you in your cell?,thor_dark_world
Loki,Who put me there? Who put me there?! [Thor grabs hold of Loki],thor_dark_world
Thor,You know damn well! You know damn well who! [Thor raises his fist to punch Loki but stops himself] She wouldn't want us to fight.,thor_dark_world
Loki,"Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked. [they both smile]",thor_dark_world
Thor,I wish I could trust you. [Thor turns his back to Loki],thor_dark_world
Loki,"Trust my rage. [back on Earth, Darcy and Ian go to free Erik from the mental institution]",thor_dark_world
desk officer,"You'll have to sign for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig. [Ian looks distracted and Darcy nudges him to bring him to attention]",thor_dark_world
ian boothby,"What? Oh, yeah. My father, Dr. Erik Selvig. [Ian goes to sign the form]",thor_dark_world
desk officer,"One; a man's leather wallet, brown. One key ring with three keys. Prescription medicine. [he places the, wallet, key ring with the keys and a plastic bag containing medicine bottles on the counter] Various. [the officer then bends to pick up another item from behind the counter, at the same time Darcy notices Erik being escorted towards them]",thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,Erik.,thor_dark_world
desk officer,And... [the officer places Erik's gadgets on the counter] These.,thor_dark_world
ian boothby,"Yeah, those. Thank goodness. [as Erik comes towards Darcy]",thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,Erik.,thor_dark_world
erik selvig,Yes?,thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,It's uh...Darcy.,thor_dark_world
erik selvig,"Darcy. [Darcy holds up her hands and smiles, Erik then hugs her] It's so good to see you.",thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,Uh...I missed you too. [Darcy looks awkward as Erik continues to hold her tightly],thor_dark_world
erik selvig,How did you find me?,thor_dark_world
ian boothby,You were naked on TV.,thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,"Okay, time to go. Lots to do. [Erik continues to hold her] Getting weird now. [as they walk down the corridor of the mental institution with Ian holding Erik's gadgets] I should not be left in charge of stuff like this, I don't get paid enough. I don't get paid period. [Erik takes his bag of medicine from Ian]",thor_dark_world
ian boothby,I'm uh...Ian by the way. Uh..Darcy's intern. I don't get paid either. [Ian watches as Erik takes out a bottle of pills] Are you alright?,thor_dark_world
erik selvig,I have had a God in my brain. I don't recommend it. [as they step out of the building suddenly the gadget in Ian arms starts to beep],thor_dark_world
ian boothby,"Dr. Selvig, your gear is beeping at me.",thor_dark_world
erik selvig,"It's happening, sooner than I calculated.",thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,"Wait, what's happening? [they look up to see flock of birds flying above them] Birds? Birds are happening?",thor_dark_world
ian boothby,"They're starlings, it's called a murmuration. My dad used to take me bird watching as a kid.",thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,Erik?,thor_dark_world
erik selvig,Look. [suddenly the birds all fly in the same direction and they all suddenly disappear],thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,"Where did they go? [suddenly all the birds appear behind, them flying away frantically making Darcy screams in terror] What the hell was that?! [Erik smiles] Why are you smiling?",thor_dark_world
erik selvig,"There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are. [he walks ahead and throws his bag of medicine into the garbage bin nearby] Take me to Jane's lab! [on Svartalfheim, as they continue flying on their ship suddenly Jane's eyes open, it's clear that the Aether has taken her over, she rises and looks ahead]",thor_dark_world
Thor,Jane.,thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Malekith. [after landing their ship, they walk over to watch Malekith and his men in the distance]",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Alright, are you ready? [Jane nods her head]",thor_dark_world
Loki,I am. [they rise from their hiding spot and Malekith spots them standing on a hill in the distance] You know this plan of yours is going to get us killed.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"Yeah, possibly. [Loki holds up his shackled hands for Thor to uncuff him]",thor_dark_world
Loki,"You still don't trust me, brother?",thor_dark_world
Thor,Would you? [Thor takes off Loki's cuffs],thor_dark_world
Loki,"No, I wouldn't. [suddenly Loki takes out a dagger stabs Thor and throws him down the hill]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Thor! No! [Malekith sees this and starts walking towards them] [after stabbing Thor and throwing him down the hill, Loki walks over to Thor]",thor_dark_world
Loki,"You really think I cared about Frigga, about any of you? [he kicks Thor in the stomach] All I ever wanted was you and Odin dead at my feet! [Thor raises his hand, attempting to summon Mjolnir, but Loki cuts off his hand making Thor scream out in pain, Jane rushes over to Thor but Loki grabs her and turns to face Malekith and his dark elves] Malekith, I am Loki of Jotunheim and I bring you a gift! [he throws Jane at Malekith's feet] I ask only one thing in return, a good seat from which to watch Asgard burn.",thor_dark_world
algrim,"[to Malekith] [subtitled] He is an enemy of Asgard, he was locked in a cell. [Malekith walks over to Thor squirming in pain on the ground]",thor_dark_world
malekith,"Look at me. [Malekith uses his foot to turn Thor, he then lifts Jane in the air and extracts the Aether from her, in that moment Jane has a vision of Earth, then as the Aether leaves her body Jane falls to the ground]",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Loki, now! [Loki uses his diversion tactics and we see that he had never amputated Thor's hand, Thor quickly summons Mjolnir and shoots lightning at the Aether attempting to destroy it, but he fails as Malekith is still able to absorb it and turns to leave on his ship] [two of the dark elves start attacking Thor but he quickly takes them down, Algrim then throws one of his vortex weapons in the air, Loki pushes Jane away and he is nearly sucked in when Thor pulls him out, Thor then attacks Algrim but he beats Thor down, Loki goes over to them and impales Algrim from behind, Algrim slowly turns and suddenly pulls Loki into the blade that is sticking out from him] No! [Algrim takes a step towards Loki]",thor_dark_world
Loki,"See you in hell, monster! [Algrim then realizes that attached to the blade in him is his own vortex weapon, it explodes before he can do anything destroying him; Thor then rushes over to Loki]",thor_dark_world
Thor,"No. No, no, no! Oh, you fool, you didn't listen!",thor_dark_world
Loki,I know. I'm a fool. I'm a fool! [Loki squirms in pain],thor_dark_world
Thor,"Stay with me, okay?",thor_dark_world
Loki,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.,thor_dark_world
Thor,Shh.,thor_dark_world
Loki,I'm sorry.,thor_dark_world
Thor,It's okay. [Thor nods his head] It's alright. I'll tell father what you did here today.,thor_dark_world
Loki,"I didn't do it for him. [he closes his eyes and as he dies his skin turns to it's blue Frost Giant form, Thor cries out in anguish]",thor_dark_world
Thor,"No! [Thor looks at Jane as he weeps for Loki] [after Loki's death, Thor and Jane enter a cave as they see a storm approaching]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"He's gonna unleash it, not just on Asgard or on a star, Malekith is gonna destroy everything.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"How? Jane, how?",thor_dark_world
jane foster,I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?,thor_dark_world
Thor,The Convergence.,thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Oh, God. None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.",thor_dark_world
Thor,Then Malekith would have only possessed it that much sooner.,thor_dark_world
jane foster,I only found it because I was looking for you.,thor_dark_world
Thor,Jane. [he places his hand on her face],thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Now we're trapped here. [suddenly they hear music playing, Jane and Thor look at each other in confusion]",thor_dark_world
Thor,"It's not me. [Jane realizes it's her cell phone, she takes it out of her pocket and answers it]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,Hello?,thor_dark_world
richard,"Hi, Jane, it's Richard.",thor_dark_world
jane foster,Richard?! Where are you?,thor_dark_world
richard,I'm still in the office. It's...It's been a crazy day here today. [Jane puts him on speaker and holds up her phone],thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Oh, my God! This is amazing.",thor_dark_world
richard,Is it? I quite enjoyed our lunch despite never actually ordering anything.,thor_dark_world
jane foster,How am I getting service here?,thor_dark_world
richard,Is this a bad time? Do you want me to try you there?,thor_dark_world
jane foster,"No, no, no, no! Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.",thor_dark_world
richard,Okay then. I was just wondering if you want to try again? Uh...maybe dinner next time.,thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Uh...yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...just stay on the phone, okay?",thor_dark_world
richard,"Yeah, I will. [Jane looks down and notices can and keys that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Oh, my God. [Jane picks up the keys from the floor of the cave]",thor_dark_world
richard,Am I interrupting something.,thor_dark_world
jane foster,"No, no, no, nothing at all. [realizing how they can return to Earth, Jane turns to Thor] Come on.",thor_dark_world
richard,"I'm losing you there, are you in a tunnel? [Thor starts following Jane]",thor_dark_world
Thor,Where are we going?,thor_dark_world
richard,"[to Jane] Hello? [they start walking further into the cave, Thor notices the discarded shoes that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]",thor_dark_world
Thor,Why are there so many shoes in here? [as they walks further in suddenly they disappear; back in his office Richard loses Jane on the phone],thor_dark_world
richard,"I'll just text her. [Jane and Thor appear back on Earth outside the factory, they get into Ian's abandoned car still parked outside the factory and Jane tries to start the car]",thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,Jane!,thor_dark_world
jane foster,Hey.,thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,"You can't just leave like that, the whole world is going crazy! [Thor hangs his hammer on the coat hanger next to the door] All the stuff we saw is spreading. [she looks at Jane's Asgardian clothes and disheveled state] Did you go to a party? [Jane notices Erik for the first time]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,Erik?!,thor_dark_world
erik selvig,"Jane, how wonderful! [he rises and goes to Jane and as he embraces her we see he isn't wearing any pants] You've been to Asgard.",thor_dark_world
jane foster,Where are your pants?,thor_dark_world
ian boothby,"Oh, uh...he uh...he says it helps him think.",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Okay. Well, I'm gonna need everything you got on this. All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.",thor_dark_world
erik selvig,Okay.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"Are you well, Erik? [Erik chuckles then his smile fades quickly]",thor_dark_world
erik selvig,"Your brother is not coming, is he?",thor_dark_world
Thor,Loki is dead.,thor_dark_world
erik selvig,"Oh, thank God. [Thor looks at him in confusion] I...I'm so sorry.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Thank you. [Erik then embraces Thor] [back on Svartalfheim we see an Einherjar Guard use the ship that brought Thor, Loki and Jane onto the planet to return to Asgard, he goes to see Odin at the palace]",thor_dark_world
einherjar guard,"Forgive me, my liege. I've returned from the Dark World with news.",thor_dark_world
Odin,Thor?,thor_dark_world
einherjar guard,"There's no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but... [he takes a step closer to Odin]",thor_dark_world
Odin,What?,thor_dark_world
einherjar guard,We found a body. [there's a moment's pause],thor_dark_world
Odin,Loki. [the warrior doesn't reply but just looks at Odin] [back at Jane's apartment],thor_dark_world
jane foster,Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot where all the nine worlds are connected.,thor_dark_world
erik selvig,"Amplifying the weapon's impact. With each additional world, the power will increase exponentially. The effect would be universal.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Yes, well the alignment is only temporary. He must be in exactly at the right place at the right time.",thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,"Well, how do we know where that is?",thor_dark_world
ian boothby,Greenwich?,thor_dark_world
jane foster,"The walls between worlds will be almost non-existent. Physics is gonna go ballistic. Increase and decrease in gravity, spatial extrusions. The very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart. [Thor summons Mjolnir and it shoots over to Thor's hand from the where it was hanging on the coat hanger]",thor_dark_world
erik selvig,I better get my pants. [in Greenwich at the location outside a library Darcy and Ian grab Erik's gadget],thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,"Focus, this is important. We have to hammer them in all around the site and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.",thor_dark_world
ian boothby,They're taped together!,thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,Do you even know what these things do?,thor_dark_world
ian boothby,No.,thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,"Neither do I. [Darcy and Ian start placing Erik's gadgets around the library grounds] Come on, come on!",thor_dark_world
ian boothby,Fine! [suddenly Malekith's giant ship appears on the River Thames near the library grounds],thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,"Holy shit! [the ship starts moving forward and crashing through the library grounds causing pandemonium until it finally stops in the middle of the grounds, Malekith and his dark elves step off the ship and the same time Thor flies in and lands in front of Malekith]",thor_dark_world
malekith,"You needn't have come so far, Asgardian! Death would have come to you soon enough.",thor_dark_world
Thor,Not by your hand!,thor_dark_world
malekith,Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be extinguished. [Malekith uses the power of the Aether to attack Thor but Thor manages to narrowly miss getting hit by it] [inside the library setting up the gravimetric device],thor_dark_world
erik selvig,We're running out of time.,thor_dark_world
jane foster,Almost there.,thor_dark_world
erik selvig,"Are you sure this is going to work? These devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Oh, come on. [Jane looks out and sees Thor and Malekith battling it out] Come on, Darcy. [Jane rushes off to find Darcy; outside Thor manages to deflect the Aether that Malekith is using to fight him off]",thor_dark_world
Thor,"You know with all that power, I thought you would hit harder. [as Malekith is using the Aether to shield himself suddenly Thor throws his hammer at him which throws Malekith across the ground and smashes him against the library building, at the same time Jane sees Darcy and Ian placing the last of Erik's device in the ground]",thor_dark_world
ian boothby,Done. [Darcy gives the OK sign to Jane and Jane rushes back to Erik],thor_dark_world
erik selvig,The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.,thor_dark_world
jane foster,"That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight. [Jane gets the device ready] Okay, you might wanna hold on to something. [she turns on the device and suddenly some of the dark elves suddenly disappear; Darcy and Ian watch this nearby, Darcy talks to Jane on her phone]",thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,That is awesome! How did you do that?,thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Well, gravitational fields interact with the weak spot between worlds creating...",thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,"Oh, there's a guy with a sword! [Jane uses the device again to make the dark elf disappear but instead she accidentally makes Darcy and Ian disappear]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,Oops.,thor_dark_world
erik selvig,Let's go. [Darcy and Ian appear in another part of London],thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,What the hell just happened? [suddenly the dark elves that had also disappeared appear and fall onto a parked car] Move! [Darcy grabs hold of Ian's hand and they run off as the dark elves start chasing after them; back at the library Thor and Malekith continue their battle and everyone inside the library rushes to the windows to watch],thor_dark_world
jane foster,What are you all doing? You need to get out of here! Now!,thor_dark_world
student,"You're joking, right? That's Thor out there waving his hammer around and everything! [he uses his phone to record the battle outside; in their ensuing fight, Thor and Malekith are transported through the realms to Svartalfheim and London continuously, at the same time a fighter jet flies towards Malekith's ship]",thor_dark_world
control,Confirming ship is hostile.,thor_dark_world
pilot,"Confirm, the ship is hostile. You have permission to engage.",thor_dark_world
control,Roger. The missile's locked. The missile's on its way. [the pilot releases the missile] Missile off target! I repeat...,thor_dark_world
pilot,Mayday! I'm losing control. Mayday! Mayday! I'm losing control! [the jet is then transported to Valaheim] [as they run through the library ground],thor_dark_world
erik selvig,What are you doing?,thor_dark_world
jane foster,My signal's lost connection. [some of the dark elves are behind them chasing after them],thor_dark_world
erik selvig,"Jane! Come on! [as Thor and Malekith continue their battle through the realms they land in Jotunheim and are confronted by a giant beast which then is transported to London, at the same time Darcy and Ian are being ambushed by the dark elves when Ian, with the help of the anti-gravitational energy force, grabs a car and throws it at them, Darcy looks at him in shock]",thor_dark_world
ian boothby,Are you alright?,thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,You saved my life.,thor_dark_world
ian boothby,"Yeah. Yes, I did. [back at the library grounds Jane manages to make the device work again and as she uses it suddenly makes Darcy and Ian appear behind her in each others arms kissing]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,Darcy?,thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,Jane! [Darcy lets go of Ian and falls to the ground],thor_dark_world
erik selvig,Ian?,thor_dark_world
ian boothby,Selvig! [suddenly Mjolnir appears and flies past them],thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,Meowmeow! [Thor and Malekith are then transported through the realms again with Malekith landing back in Greenwich but Thor ends up in Charing Cross Underground Station],thor_dark_world
man,[over speakers] Mind the gap.,thor_dark_world
Thor,How do I get to Greenwich?,thor_dark_world
woman on train,"Take this train, three stops. [Thor steps onto the train and places his hand on the bar above him]",thor_dark_world
man,[over speakers] Mind the gap.,thor_dark_world
woman on train,Sorry. Sorry. [Thor smiles politely at her],thor_dark_world
jane foster,We're out of time. [Jane rushes off ahead],thor_dark_world
erik selvig,Jane. Jane! [Thor rushes out of the station to watch the Aether taking over],thor_dark_world
jane foster,Thor! We're too late.,thor_dark_world
erik selvig,The Convergence is at its peak. [Thor looks at the gadget spears in Erik's hand],thor_dark_world
Thor,Can those things stop him?,thor_dark_world
erik selvig,Not from here.,thor_dark_world
jane foster,We can't get close enough. [Thor looks at Jane],thor_dark_world
Thor,I can. [Thor takes the spears from Erik and rushes off towards Malekith] [Thor pushes through the Aether and reaches Malekith] Malekith! [Malekith turns to face Thor],thor_dark_world
malekith,"Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?",thor_dark_world
Thor,"I've come to accept your surrender. [Thor throws one of Erik's gadget spears at Malekith and he catches it, Jane uses the gavemetric which makes his arm disappear and we see it transported to Svartalfheim, Thor throws the other spear at Malekith and he catches it and his other arm disappears]",thor_dark_world
malekith,You think you can stop this? The Aether cannot be destroyed.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"But you can. [Thor summons Mjolnir at the same time he rushes towards Malekith and as he grabs his hammer he uses it to throw Malekith into his ship and Jane is able to use her device to transport him Svartalfheim] [after Thor kills Malekith Jane goes to find Thor and finds him lying on the ground, suddenly Malekith's ship starts to crumble, Jane rushes towards the unconscious Thor]",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Thor! No! [Jane turns Thor over grabs his arm and starts to pull him out of the way but he is too heavy, just them Erik, Darcy and Ian arrive on the scene]",thor_dark_world
erik selvig,"Jane! [the ship starts to fall, as Jane is not able to move Thor she throws herself on top of him and holds on to him with her eyes closed, just as the ship is about to land on them it disappears and appears on Svartalfheim landing on Malekith and crushing him to death; back in Greenwich] Everybody okay? [Thor becomes conscious and opens his eyes, Darcy smiles and throws her arms around Ian and kisses him passionately] [couple of days later, Jane, Erik, Darcy and Ian are in her apartment sat having breakfast quietly]",thor_dark_world
darcy lewis,"He's gonna come back. Except, you know, last time he was gone for, like, two years.",thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Well, it's only been two days, so...",thor_dark_world
erik selvig,Did he say anything before he left?,thor_dark_world
jane foster,"Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father. He kind of committed treason... on our way out. [Jane looks away and carries on eating her breakfast]",thor_dark_world
erik selvig,Oh.,thor_dark_world
Odin,You once said there would never be a wiser King than me. You were wrong. The alignment has brought all the realms together. Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them. What can Asgard offer its new King in return?,thor_dark_world
Thor,"My life. Father, I cannot be King of Asgard. I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath, but I cannot do so from that chair. Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will. The brutality, the sacrifice, it changes you. I'd rather be a good man than a great King.",thor_dark_world
Odin,"Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?",thor_dark_world
Thor,"When you speak, do I never hear Mother's voice? [Odin sighs] This is not for Jane, Father. She does not know what I came here to say. Now forbid me to see her or say she can rule at my side, it changes nothing.",thor_dark_world
Odin,"One son who wanted the throne too much, another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Loki died with honor, I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough? [Odin nods his head, Thor then holds up Mjolnir to offer it back to Odin]",thor_dark_world
Odin,"It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.",thor_dark_world
Thor,I shall try to be.,thor_dark_world
Odin,"I cannot give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.",thor_dark_world
Thor,I know. [Thor turns to leave],thor_dark_world
Odin,"If I were proud of the man my son had become, even that I could not say. It would speak only from my heart. Go, my son. [Thor smiles]",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Thank you, father. [he turns and starts walking off, as Odin watches Thor walk off Odin's form transform to reveal Loki]",thor_dark_world
Loki,"No. Thank you. [Loki smiles devilishly] [mid-credits scene; Sif and Volstagg are taken to meet, The Collector Taneleer Tivan]",thor_dark_world
collector's assistant,"I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.",thor_dark_world
the collector,"Woh, Oh. Asgardians, it's an honor. [he bows theatrically]",thor_dark_world
Sif,You know why we're here.,thor_dark_world
the collector,"Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure in your own vault?",thor_dark_world
volstagg,The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It's not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.,thor_dark_world
the collector,That's very wise. [Sif hands the Aether over to The Collector] I can assure you it will be absolutely safe in...in my collection.,thor_dark_world
Sif,"See that it is. [The Collector bows his head, Sif and Volstagg turn and leave]",thor_dark_world
the collector,"One down, five to go. [after credits scene; at her apartment Jane, Erik, Darcy and Ian hear the sounds of thunder, Jane looks out and smiles as she sees lightning, Jane walks out onto her balcony as Thor appears, they embrace and start kissing passionately; at the same time we see the beast transported from Jotunheim running amok outside the abandoned factory]",thor_dark_world
Sif,I've got this completely under control!,thor_dark_world
Thor,Is that why everything's on fire?,thor_dark_world
Sif,All yours. [steps back],thor_dark_world
Thor,Hello. [the beast roars] I accept your surrender.,thor_dark_world
Thor,Anyone else?,thor_dark_world
Loki,[mock salute to Odin] I really don't see what all the fuss is about…,thor_dark_world
Odin,"Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death!",thor_dark_world
Loki,"I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God, just like you.",thor_dark_world
Odin,"We are not gods. We're born, we live, we die, just as humans do.",thor_dark_world
Loki,Give or take five thousand years.,thor_dark_world
Odin,All this because Loki desires a throne...,thor_dark_world
Loki,It is my birthright!,thor_dark_world
Odin,"Your birthright was to DIE! As a child, cast out on a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in, you would not be here now, to hate me.",thor_dark_world
Loki,"If I'm for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't like our little talks, it's just... I don't love them.",thor_dark_world
Odin,"Frigga is the only reason you're still alive, and you will never see her again. You'll spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.",thor_dark_world
Loki,And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf King while I rot in chains?,thor_dark_world
Odin,"Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the Nine Realms, and then, yes, he will be King.",thor_dark_world
darcy,"Come on, this is exciting. Look! The intern is excited.",thor_dark_world
ian,"Ian, my name's Ian.",thor_dark_world
darcy,Do you want the phase meter?,thor_dark_world
jane,No.,thor_dark_world
darcy,Bring the phase meter. The toaster looking thing.,thor_dark_world
ian,Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.,thor_dark_world
Thor,Jane?,thor_dark_world
jane foster,Sorry. I just…needed to make sure you were real. It's been a very e day.,thor_dark_world
Thor,I am. Jane—,thor_dark_world
jane,Where were you?!,thor_dark_world
Thor,Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.,thor_dark_world
jane,"I was right here where you left me! I was waiting, and then I was crying, and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"I know. I know, but the Bifröst was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos. Wars were raging, marauders were pillaging…I had to put an end to the slaughter.",thor_dark_world
jane,"As excuses go, it's not…terrible…But I saw you on TV! You were in New York!",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong. I was a fool. I believe that fate brought us together.",thor_dark_world
malekith,"[looking out over the ruins of Svartalfheim] Look upon my legacy, Algrim. I can barely remember a time before the light.",thor_dark_world
algrim,Our survival will be your legacy.,thor_dark_world
malekith,The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world. And I will put an end to this poisoned universe.,thor_dark_world
Odin,She does not belong in Asgard any more than a goat belongs at a banquet!,thor_dark_world
jane,Did he just-? Who do you think you are?,thor_dark_world
Odin,I am Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.,thor_dark_world
jane,Oh. Well I'm-,thor_dark_world
Odin,"I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.",thor_dark_world
jane,[to Thor] You told your dad about me?,thor_dark_world
frigga,You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.,thor_dark_world
Loki,My actions? I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life…that I was born to be a king.,thor_dark_world
frigga,A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?,thor_dark_world
Loki,A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.,thor_dark_world
frigga,Your father—,thor_dark_world
Loki,He's not my father!,thor_dark_world
frigga,Then am I not your mother?,thor_dark_world
Loki,You're not.,thor_dark_world
frigga,[looks hurt but chuckles] You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself. [Loki looks sorry and reaches for her but she disappears],thor_dark_world
frigga,"Stand down, creature, and you may still survive this.",thor_dark_world
malekith,"I have survived worse, woman.",thor_dark_world
frigga,Who are you?,thor_dark_world
malekith,"I am Malekith... [looks at Jane] and I would have what is mine. [They both draw swords and duel, until Algrim arrives and helps overpower Frigga. Malekith turns to confront Jane] You have taken something, child. Give it back. [Malekith discovers Jane is an illusion and angrily faces a grinning Frigga] WITCH! Where is the Aether?!",thor_dark_world
frigga,I'll never tell you.,thor_dark_world
malekith,I believe you. [Algrim kills Frigga],thor_dark_world
Loki,Thor. After all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?,thor_dark_world
Thor,"Loki, enough. No more illusions. [Loki and the neat room turn to a destroyed room with Loki looking disheveled on the floor]",thor_dark_world
Loki,"Now you see me, brother. Did she suffer? [referring to Frigga]",thor_dark_world
Thor,"I did not come here to share our grief. Instead, I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.",thor_dark_world
Loki,Go on.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard, and I will grant it to you. Vengeance. And afterward, this cell.",thor_dark_world
Loki,[chuckles] You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?,thor_dark_world
Thor,"I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me, and I will kill you.",thor_dark_world
Loki,Hm. When do we start?,thor_dark_world
jane,You're…,thor_dark_world
Loki,I'm Loki. You may have heard—,thor_dark_world
jane,That was for New York!,thor_dark_world
Loki,[to Thor] I like her.,thor_dark_world
Sif,"Betray him, and I'll kill you.",thor_dark_world
Loki,"Good to see you too, Sif.",thor_dark_world
volstagg,If you even think about betraying him…,thor_dark_world
Loki,"You'll kill me? Evidently, there will be a line.",thor_dark_world
Loki,"You know, this is wonderful! This a tremendous idea! Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that! Flying around the city, smash it into everything in sight so everyone can see us! It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant- [Thor shoves Loki out of the ship, and jumps out with Jane in his arms into a skiff piloted by Fandral]",thor_dark_world
fandral,"[laughs] I see your time in the dungeon has made you no less graceful, Loki!",thor_dark_world
Loki,[to Thor] You lied to me. I'm impressed.,thor_dark_world
Loki,"[steering the skiff towards a tiny crevice in the mountain] If it were easy, everyone would do it.",thor_dark_world
Thor,Are you mad?,thor_dark_world
Loki,Possibly.,thor_dark_world
Thor,"You think you alone were loved of Mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!",thor_dark_world
Loki,"Trust? Was that her last expression, trust? While you let her die?!",thor_dark_world
Thor,What good were you in your cell?,thor_dark_world
Loki,Who put me there? Who put me there?!,thor_dark_world
Thor,You know damn well! You know damn well who! [pins Loki and is about to hit him but lets him go] She wouldn't want us to fight.,thor_dark_world
Loki,"Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.",thor_dark_world
Thor,[chuckles] I wish I could trust you.,thor_dark_world
Loki,[whispers] Trust my rage.,thor_dark_world
Thor,[holding a dying Loki] I will tell Father what you did here today.,thor_dark_world
Loki,I didn't do it for him.,thor_dark_world
darcy,What the hell was that? [to a grinning Dr. Selvig] Why are you smiling?,thor_dark_world
dr. erik selvig,There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.,thor_dark_world
malekith,"You needn't have come so far, Asgardian. Death would have come to you soon enough.",thor_dark_world
Thor,Not by your hand!,thor_dark_world
malekith,Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be EXTINGUISHED!,thor_dark_world
malekith,"Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?",thor_dark_world
Thor,I've come to accept your surrender.,thor_dark_world
malekith,You think you can stop this?! The Aether cannot be destroyed!,thor_dark_world
Thor,But you can. [summons Mjolnir and deals the final blow to Malekith],thor_dark_world
Odin,"One son who wanted the throne too much, and another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?",thor_dark_world
Thor,Loki died with honour. I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough? [offers the hammer],thor_dark_world
Odin,"It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.",thor_dark_world
Thor,I shall try to be.,thor_dark_world
Odin,"I can not give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.",thor_dark_world
Thor,I know. [turns to leave],thor_dark_world
Odin,"If I were proud of the man my son has become, even that I could not say, it would speak only from my heart. Go, my son.",thor_dark_world
Thor,"Thank you, Father. [leaves]",thor_dark_world
Loki,[appears from Odin's guise] No... thank you.,thor_dark_world
carina,I present to you Taneleer Tivan. The Collector.,thor_dark_world
the collector,Asgardians! It's an honor.,thor_dark_world
Sif,"You know why we're here. [she hands him the Aether, which he accepts]",thor_dark_world
the collector,"Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure, in your own vault?",thor_dark_world
volstagg,The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It would be unwise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.,thor_dark_world
the collector,"That's very wise. I can assure you, it will be absolutely safe here in my collection.",thor_dark_world

Drax,What?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,What are they called again?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Anulax batteries.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Harbulary batteries.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,That's nothing like what I just said. But they're worth thousands of units a piece. Which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Just be careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended and the cost of transgression is death.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Sounds judgmental for a bunch of golden morons.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,That's the kind of thing you might want to keep to yourself.,guardians_galaxy_vol2

ayesha,"Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community, impeccable, both physically and mentally. We control the DNA of our progeny, germinating them in birthing pods.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I guess I prefer making people the old-fashioned way.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,Well... perhaps someday you could give me a history lesson in the archaic ways of our ancestors... for academic purposes.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Yeah, I mean, if it's for research that could be pretty --",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Pretty repulsive. I'm not into that kind of casual -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"Oh, please.  Your people promised something in trade for our services. Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Family reunion. Yaaaay.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,I understand she is your sister?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries. Do with her as you please.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,"What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,My mother is from earth.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,And your father?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"He's... not from Missouri, that's all I know.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,"I see it within you, an unorthodox genealogy. A hybrid that seems particularly... reckless.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags. But that isn't true at all.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Oh, shit, I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?  I'm sorry. That was meant to be behind your back.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,You're telling me. You wanna buy some batteries?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Let's get baldy back to Xandar and retrieve that bounty!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,You all right?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,That stuff about my father. Who does she think she is?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I know you're sensitive about that.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I'm not sensitive about it. I just don't know who he is.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Sorry if it looked like I was flirting with her. I wasn't.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I don't care if you were.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I think you do care. That's why I'm apologizing.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"There are two types of beings in the universe. Those who dance, and those who do not.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Uh huh.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,I first met my beloved at a war rally. ,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing. Except one woman. My Ovette. I knew immediately she was the one.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"The most melodic song in the world could be playing, and she wouldn't even tap her foot. She wouldn't move a muscle. One might assume she was dead.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Well, that is pretty hot, but--",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,It would make my nether regions ENGORGE -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"All right, okay, fascinating, don't need to hear it. I get your point, I'm a dancer and Gamora is not.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"You just need to find a woman who is pathetic, like you.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,I am hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,No. It's not ripe yet. And I hate you.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"You hate me?! You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself. Yet here you stand, a hero, a Garden of the Galaxy!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,A what?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,`Guardians of the Galaxy.',guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,Oh.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Why would we be `the Gardens of the Galaxy'?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,I don't know. I thought it was stupid.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"Yeah, it would be.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,It's still wordy.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I wasn't the one who thought of it.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"Your name doesn't matter. I'll be free of these shackles soon enough, and I'll kill you, I swear.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"No. You'll live out your days in a prison on Xandar, wishing you could.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"We got an armed Sovereign fleet, approaching from the rear.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Why would they do that?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Probably because Rocket stole some of their batteries.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Dude.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"Oh, right. He didn't steal one of those. I don't know why they're after us. What a mystery this is.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,What were you thinking?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Dude, it was really easy to steal.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,That's your defense?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Come on. You saw how that high- priestess talked down to us! I'm teaching her a lesson!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Oh! I didn't realize your motivation was altruism. A shame the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions and are trying to kill us.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Exactly.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I WAS BEING SARCASTIC!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Oh no! You tricked me! You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"SHUT UP, DRAX! You knew! You should have told us!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Did you tell him it was easy to steal?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Are you kidding me?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,What?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,You never listen to anything!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,None of you listens! Can we please just put the bickering on hold until after we survive the massive space battle?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Whoa. Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Do not try to bro down with me right now, dude. I will fricking punch you in your fricking face.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Real nice! Resorting to violence.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,More incoming!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,GOOD! I WANT TO KILL SOME GUYS!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
sovereign pilot,Bloody hell!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,You're not killing anyone. Those ships are all remotely piloted.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,"What is the delay, Admiral?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
admiral,"High Priestess, if we destroy their craft, we risk destroying the batteries. They're extraordinarily combustible and could, in turn, destroy the entire fleet.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,We have thousands of batteries and thousands of ships. Our concern is their slight against our people. We hired them and they steal from us? It is heresy of the highest order.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
admiral,All command modules -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
admiral,Fire with the intent to kill.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,What's the closest habitable planet?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,It's called Berhert.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,How many jumps?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Only one. But the access point is 47 clicks away. And it's through that Quantum Asteroid Field over there.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"Quill, to make it through that, you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Lucky for us -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,I am.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,What are you doing?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I've been flying this rig since I was ten years old.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Stop it!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Quill, later on tonight you're gonna lay down in your bed and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillowcase and you're gonna be, like, `what's this?' and it's gonna be because I put a turd in there.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Oh it won't be my turd, it will be Drax's.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,I have famously huge turds.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"We're about to die, and this is what we're discussing?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,They raise havoc with the pipes. That's why I do all the plumbing. I take responsibility for my actions. Unlike some people...,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Groot, he's right, you have to start aiming inside the box.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Stop it.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,Idiots!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Well, that's what you get when Quill flies.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Ow!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,There's still a Sovereign craft behind us!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Our weapons are down!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Twenty clicks to the jump.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Where's he going?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
frightened pilot,"Come on, Zylak, you can do this.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,It's not ripe.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Fifteen clicks.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Ten clicks.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"Die, spaceship.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
frightened pilot,"You suck, Zylak.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Five clicks!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Son-of-a-! They went around the field!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
admiral,Someone destroyed all the ships.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,What?! WHO?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,What is that?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Doesn't matter! That's the jump point! GO! GO!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,It's a guy.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Oh my God.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Groot, put on your seat belt!",guardians_galaxy_vol2

Drax,That was awesome.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"Either one    of you could have gotten us through    that field, if you had flown with    what's between your ears instead of    what's between your legs!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"If what's between my legs had a hand on it, I guarantee I could have landed this ship.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"It's not funny, Peter. We almost died. Because of your arrogance.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,More like because he stoled Anulax batteries!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,They're called Harbulary batteries.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"No, they're not!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"You know why I did it, Star-Munch?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Do you?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I'm not going to answer to `Star- Munch.',guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Dick.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,What are we even talking about this for? We just had a little man save us by blowing up fifty ships!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,How little?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Like this.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,A little one-inch man saved us?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Well, if he got closer I'm sure he'd be much larger.",guardians_galaxy_vol2

Rocket Raccoon,Don't call me a raccoon!,guardians_galaxy_vol2

Rocket Raccoon,Is that better?,guardians_galaxy_vol2

Rocket Raccoon,YOU SON-OF-A-!!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,Someone followed you through the jump point.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,Set me free. You'll need my help.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"I'm not a fool, Nebula.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,You're a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,You'll attack me the moment I let you go.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"No, I won't.",guardians_galaxy_vol2

Peter Quill,He wasn't my father. Yondu was the guy who abducted me. He'd beat the crap out of me so I'd learn how to fight and he kept me in terror threatening to eat me.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Eat you?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Yes.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,That son-of-a-bitch.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,How'd you locate us now?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Even where I reside, out past the edge of what's known, we've heard tell of the man they call Star- Lord.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Say we head out that way now? Your associates are welcome, even that triangle-faced monkey there.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I promise you, it's like no place you've ever seen. And there I can explain your very special heritage, and finally be the father I've always wanted to be.  `Scuse me. I gotta take a whizz.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Not buying it.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"Peter, we need to take a walk.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,I am Mantis.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,What are you doing?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Smiling. I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Not if you do it like that.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Oh. I was raised alone on Ego's planet. I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Yes...,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,AHH!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,That's called a practical joke!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,I liked it very much!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Give me a break! After all this time, and he just expects to be my Dad all of the sudden!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I hear you.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"I mean, this could be a trap - the Kree purists, the Ravagers, now the Sovereign - they all want us dead.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"I know, but -",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,But what?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Who?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,The wonderful television-singer man. He had a magic boat.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,David Hasselhoff?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Right.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"He had a talking car, not a magic -",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Why did it talk again?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Just to be a good friend, I guess.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"And as a child you carried his picture in your pocket, and you told the other children he was your father, but he was out of town --",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany. Why are you bringing this up now? I was drunk when I told you that.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I love that story.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"I don't. It's just sad! I was so sad because I'd see the other kids off playing catch with their dads, and I wanted that, more than anything in the world.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"My point is, maybe this man is your Hasselhoff. I know it's a long shot. But I lost my father as a child. I'd give anything...",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"If he ends up being evil, we'll just kill him.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,What's funny?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,You're leaving me with that fox?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,He's not a fox.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Shoot her if she does anything suspicious. Or if you feel like it.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,It will just be a couple days. We'll be back before Rocket's finished fixing the ship.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,What about your spool of songs?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I have clones.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,What if the Sovereign come?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,There's no way for them to know they're here.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,I am uncertain about parting ways.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,You're like an old woman.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Because I am wise?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Hope daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,So what's your goal here? To get everyone to hate you? `Cause it's working.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Can I ask you a personal question?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,"Oh, no one has ever asked me a personal question!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"The antennae, what are they for?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Their purpose?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"Yes, Quill and I have a bet.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,You're not supposed to say that.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"I say that if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low, your antennae will feel this, and stop you from being decapitated.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Just making clear - if it's anything else - any other answer - I win?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,They are not for feeling doorways.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Damn. I just lost my entire life's savings.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Three pairs of pants.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,I think they have something to do with my empathic abilities.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,What are - ?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,If I touch someone I can feel their FEELINGS -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,You read minds?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,No. Telepaths know thoughts. Empaths feel feelings. Emotions.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,May I?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,You feel love.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Yeah, I guess, yeah, I have sort of a general, unselfish love for everyone.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,"No, romantic, sexual love.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"No. No, I don't.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,For her.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,No.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret, Quill! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"What the hell, dude? That's a total overreaction.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,DO ME! DO ME!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,I have never felt such humor!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,You got to be kidding me.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,That's so incredibly uncool.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Touch me. And the only thing you're going to feel is a broken jaw.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,"I can also alter emotions, to some extent.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Like what?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,"If I touch someone who is sad I can ease them into contentment, for a short while. I can make a stubborn person compliant. But I mostly use it to help my Master sleep. He lies awake at night, thinking about his progeny.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Do one of those on me!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Sleep.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Is that real?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"It's kind of like someone put a baby's head on a big, muscular body, isn't it?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
tall ravager,There!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
brahl,"Ain't so tough now without all your toys, are you?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Crap.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Hey there, rat.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"How's it going, you blue idiot?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Eh, not so bad. We got a pretty good gig. A golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals to her, so she can kill y'all.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,Your friend. There's too many of them. They're going to kill him.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"He needs my help. If you care about him, you need to get me out of these bonds.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Pretty easy to find you, since we put a tracer on your ship back during the War over Xandar.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"You give me your word you won't hurt Groot, and I'll tell you where the batteries are.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,Lucky for you my word don't mean squat. Otherwise I'd actually hand you over.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
monstrous ravager,Otherwise you'd what?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,We'll take the batteries. They're worth a a quarter mil on the open MARKET -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
monstrous ravager,That priestess offered us a million! A quarter is only one third of that!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,A quarter ain't one-th -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
oblo,A quarter is four times a million! We're in the money!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,NO -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"The point is, we aren't stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy. We'd have the whole Nova Corps on us.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,"That ain't right. I just gotta say it this one time, Cap'n.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,"No matter how many times Quill betrays you, you protect him, like none of the rest of us much matter. I'm the one what sticks up for you, me and Tullk.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,UH -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
tullk,Put you damn guns down!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Hold on! There's got to be some sort of peaceful resolution here! Or even a violent resolution, where I'm standing over there.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"Well, hello, boys.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,It's not ripe.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Welcome, friends, to my world.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Wow. You have your own planet?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"But a trifle, no larger than your earth's moon.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"Humility. I like it. I too, am extraordinarily humble.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,It's beautiful.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Peter, consider this a token of a father's pride.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"A memorial to the War Over Xandar, when you single-handedly saved the galaxy.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Single-handedly?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Whoa. It's perfect.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,You've got to be kidding.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Why am I dead? Why did you all kill me?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,That's Ronan. That's you.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,When was I that tiny?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit. What are you, exactly?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I'm what they call a Celestial, sweetheart.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,A Celestial. Like a... god?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Small `g', son. At least on the days I'm feeling humble as Drax.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"This form you see before you is only an extension of who I truly am. I don't know where I came from, exactly.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"The first thing I remember is flickering, adrift in the cosmos - utterly and entirely alone.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,I fed on the matter around me like plankton. I grew smarter and stronger.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,I formed a sheathe to protect myself from the elements.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"And continued building from there, layer by layer, the very planet you walk on now. I built the spires reaching up to the sky and the tunnels burrowing into its depths.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Wow.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,But I was no ant to be fulfilled solely by labor. I wanted more. I desired... meaning.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"There must be some life out there in the universe besides just me, I thought, and I set myself to task with finding it.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I created what I imagined biological life might be like, down to the most minute detail.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Did you make a penis?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Dude.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"If he's a planet, how did he make a baby with your mother? He would smush her.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"I don't need to hear about how my parents, you know -",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Why? My father would tell me the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,That's disgusting.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,It was beautiful. You earthers have hang-ups.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Yes, Drax, I've got a penis.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Oh my God.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"It's not half bad. I've also got pain receptors, a digestive system, and all the accompanying junk. I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human as I set out amongst the stars.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I visited thousands of planets over thousands of years, one barren husk after the next until I found what I sought...",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Life. I was not alone in this universe after all.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,When did you meet my mother?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Not long after.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"It was with Meredith that I experienced love for the first time. I called her my river lily. And from that love, Peter, you.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I searched for you for so long. When I heard a man from earth held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying, I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,If you loved her why did you leave her?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
tullk,You can't do this!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
tullk,This is mutiny! Mutiny!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
oblo,"Cap'n, help me! Cap'n?!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
monstrous ravager,You're the one what kilt those men by leading `em down the wrong path.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
monstrous ravager,Because you're weak.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
monstrous ravager,And stupid.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
monstrous ravager,It's time for the Ravagers to once again rise to glory with a new Cap'n... TASERFACE.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,I'm sorry. Your name is... it's `Taserface'?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,That's right.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Do you... shoot tasers out of your face?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,It's metaphorical!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,For what?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,It's a name what strikes fear in anyone what hears it!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Really?... Okay, sure.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,You shut up! You're next!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,"Udonta, I been waiting to do this for a long ti -",guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,What?! What?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I just keep imagining you waking up one morning, looking in the mirror, and, in all seriousness, saying `You know what would be a really kickass name? Taserface!'",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,What was your second choice?! Scrotum Hat?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,New plan. We're killing you first.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Well, dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life as a moronic shitbag who thinks `Taserface' is a cool name.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,That's enough killing for today.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,Thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,That was when Daddy was paying my bills. The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself. And he -  - has bounties on his head in at least twelve Kree provinces.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"I assure you, I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick or a talking woodland beast.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"I want ten percent of the take, and a couple more things.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,We got a whole box of hands if that one don't work out.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,It's fine.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,You think them Kree is gonna execute the Cap'n?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,"Well, there it is, best ship we got. The location of Ego's planet's in the nav. We'll wire you the ten percent when we's paid. What you gonna do with your share?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"As a child my father would have Gamora and me battle one another in `training.' Every time my sister prevailed my father would replace a piece of me with machinery, claiming he wanted me to be her equal. But she won, again and again and again. Never once refraining. Because of them, I am this. So after I murder my sister, I will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death. ",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"I will hunt my father like a dog and I will tear him apart slowly, piece by piece, until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain I know every single day.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,"Yeah... I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace. Or a nice hat. Something that'll make the other girls go `oooooo, that's nice.'",guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,"Anyway, uh, happy trails.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,My mother told everyone my father was from the stars.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,She had brain cancer - so everyone thought she was delusional.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,PETER -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Listen. I'd love to believe all of this, I really would - but you left the most wonderful woman ever, to die alone!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter. But if I don't return regularly to this planet, and the light within, this form will wither and perish --",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"So why didn't you come back?! Why'd you send Yondu, a criminal, of all people, to fetch me?!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I loved your mother, Peter! I couldn't stand to set foot on an earth where she wasn't living! You can't imagine what that's like!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I know exactly what that's like! I had to watch her die!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Over the millions and millions of years of my existence I have made many mistakes, Peter. But you're not one of them. Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"There are so many things I need to teach you. This planet, and the light within... they are a part of you.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,What do you mean?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Give me your hands, son.    Here. Hold them like that.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Now close your eyes and concentrate. Take your brain to the center of the planet.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Yes! Yes!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Whoa.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Yes, yes - it's okay. Just relax. Concentrate. You can do it. Bring it back.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Yes, yes, now - shape it -",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Feel the energy.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Yes.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"You're home, Peter.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Here.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,How did you get here?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,"Ego found me in my larva state, orphaned on my homeworld. He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,So you're a pet?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,I suppose.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,People usually want cute pets. Why would Ego want a hideous one?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,I am hideous?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"You're horrifying to look at, yes.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,But it is a good thing.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Oh?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"When you are ugly and someone loves you, you know they love you for who you are. Beautiful people never know who to trust.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,"Well, then I am certainly grateful to be ugly!  Poor Gamora. She can never trust anyone.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Those pools remind me of a time I took my daughter to visit the Forgotten Lakes on my homeworld. She was like you.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Disgusting?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Innocent.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,"I have never met anyone like you, or your friends. You are filled with such... love. It is a thing I did not know existed, not like this, and I think... I think it may be the very finest of all things. It both hurts and soothes the heart.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,"Drax, there is something I must TELL -",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,What's going on?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,I am learning many things. Like I am a pet and ugly.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,You're not ugly.  Drax.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"Mantis, can you show us where we'll be staying? I'm getting eye-strain in this place.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Why are there no other beings on this planet?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,The planet IS Ego. A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,And you're not a flea?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,I'm a flea with a purpose. I help him sleep.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Nothing.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Your quarters are this way.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,We'll deliver you to the Kree in the morning. Neither one of you gonna last much longer after that.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Okay, Taserface. See you later, Taserface. Hey, Taserface, tell the other guys we said hi, Taserface!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,"No, Gef! It's too adorable to kill. Bring it to the tailor.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,I was a Kree battle-slave for twenty years when Stakar freed me. He offered me a place in the Ravagers. Said all I needed to do was adhere to the code. But I was young and greedy and stupid - like you stealing those batteries.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,That was mostly Drax.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Me and Stakar, and the other captains - we weren't so different from you and your friends. The only family I ever had. But I broke the code. They exiled me.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,These ones here are the ones who followed - of course they're jerks. Which is what I deserve.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Slow down, drama queen. You might deserve this, but I don't. We gotta get out of here.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,Where's Quill?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Went off with his old man.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,Ego?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Yeah. It's a day for dumbass names.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"You smiled and for a second I got a warm feeling, but then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth. Ever heard of floss?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,You're like a professional asshole or - ?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Pretty much a pro. Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"He was skinny, could fit into places we couldn't. Good for thieving.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,I got an idea on how to get outta here. But we're gonna need your little friend.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
retch,Lil' feller's all worked up! Needs a drank!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
retch,Lookit how cute it is when it's all riled up!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
half-nut,It's Goddang precious!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Hey, twig. C'mere.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Oh, man. What'd they do to you?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"There's something I need you to get, and bring back to me.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"In the Cap'n's quarters, there's a prototype fin, like the thing I wore on my head.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,There's a drawer next to the bunk. It's inside that. It's red. You got it?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,That's my underwears.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know what you were talking about. You have to explain it more careful.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,All right. It's a prototype fin -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,You explain it this time.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,That's Vorker's eye. He takes it out when he sleeps. Go look again.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,But leave the eye here.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,Why?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,He's gonna wake up tomorrow and he's not gonna know where his eye is!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,That's a desk. We told you it was this big.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere with a bunch of severed human toes.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Okay, then let's just agree to never discuss this.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"The drawer you want to open. Has this symbol on it, okay?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,What? No.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,That's not what I said.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,He's relieved that you don't want him to.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,He hates hats.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"On anyone, not just himself.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head. The next minute, it's just because you realize part of that head is a hat.  That's why you don't like hats?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,This is an important conversation right now?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,No.   Let's try again.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,That ain't it.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,I didn't mean to do a mutiny.  They killed all my friends.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,Go get the third quadrant ready for release.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,One more thing.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,You got any clones of Quill's old music on the ship?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,He's got it!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,HE'S GOT IT! YONDU'S GOT THE DAMN FIN!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
retch,GO!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
scurrilous ravager,Down there!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,You maniac. The whole ship is gonna blow.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,Not the whole ship.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
chambermaid,Who is this? You're not supposed to be on this line.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
taserface,I'm sending you the coordinates for Yondu's ship.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,Release the quadrant.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,AYE CAPN',guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,"Where to, Cap'n?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Ego.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"NO, BOY!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,It ain't healthy for a mammalian body to hop over fifty jumps at a time.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,I know that.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,We're about to do seven-hundred.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,So I guess this could all be mine someday.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"Rocket? Rocket, you there?   Dammit.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"What are you doing, Peter?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Dance with me.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,No. I'm not --,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Come on. This is Sam Cooke, one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Drax thinks you're not a dancer.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"If you ever tell anyone about this, I'll kill you.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,When are we going to do something about this... unspoken thing between us?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,What unspoken thing?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,THIS CHEERS-SAM-AND-DIANE-GUY-AND- GIRL-ON-A-TV-SHOW-WHO-DIG-EACH- OTHER-BUT-NEVER-SAY-IT-'CAUSE-WHEN- THEY-DO-THE-RATINGS-WOULD-GO-DOWN sort of thing?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,There is no unspoken thing between us.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Well, that's a Catch-22. Because if you said there was, it would be spoken, and then you'd be a liar. So by saying there isn't, you're telling the truth, and admitting there is.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,That's not --,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,What we should be discussing right now is that something about this place doesn't feel right.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,What are you talking about? You were the one who wanted me to come here!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"That girl, Mantis. She's afraid of something.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Why are you trying to take this from me?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I'm not --,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,He's my father. He's blood -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,You have blood on earth. You never wanted to return there.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Again - you made me come here! And Earth?! Earth is the place my mother died in front of me.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"No, it's because that's real, and this is a fantasy.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"This is real. I'm only half human, remember?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,That's the half I'm worried about.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Oh, I get it. You're jealous because I'm part god! You like me being the weak one!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Uh. You were insufferable to begin with. I haven't been able to reach Rocket. I'm going to see if I can get a signal outside.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"You know, this isn't Cheers after all. It's whatever the show is where one person is willing to, you know, open themselves up to new possibilities, and the other person is just kind of a jerk who doesn't trust anyone! It's a show that doesn't exist - it would never be made, it would be so horrible! It would get zero ratings!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,You're having a conversation with yourself! I don't know what Cheers is!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"I finally found my family, don't you understand that!?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I thought you already had.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"So this is how it ends, then? Our whole story. Like this? You and me?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"Get it through your head, Peter. There is no you and me. There never was.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Dammit.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,You psychopath.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Are you kidding me?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,I win.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,I win. I bested you in combat.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"Uh, no, I just spared your life -",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,You were stupid enough to let me live so -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,You just let me live!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,I WIN!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"Nebula, I really don't need      I don't need you always this. My day has been bad        trying to beat me! ENOUGH -",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I'm not the one who just flew across the universe because I wanted to win!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,Don't tell me what I want!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I don't have to because you make it OBVI -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WANTED TO WIN, I JUST WANTED A SISTER!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"You were all I had, but you were the one who needed to win! Thanos pulled my eye from my head and my brain from my skull and my arm from my body because of you!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"You all right, son?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,I saw your girl stomp off earlier in quite a huff.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Yeah.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,It's fortuitous you're listening to this song.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,You know - ?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,`Brandy' by Looking Glass.   A favorite of your mom's.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Yes.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,One of earth's greatest musical compositions. Perhaps its very greatest.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Yeah, it is.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"You and I, Peter, we're the sailor in the song.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"He came on a summer's day, bringing gifts from far away - like the child I put in your mother, or the freedom you brought Gamora.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good wife you would be. But my life, my love, my lady is the sea. The sea calls the sailor back. He loves the girl, but that's not his place. The sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men, and sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Well, you might not be mortal, but ME -",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Death will remain a er to both of us as long as the light burns within the planet.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I'm immortal? That's... really?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Yes, as long as the light exists.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,And I can use the light to make cool things? Like how you made all this?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"It'll take thousands of years of practice before you get really good at it . But, yes.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Well, get ready for an eight hundred foot statue of Pac Man, then. With Skeletor. And Heather Locklear. I'm gonna make some weird shit.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,I can't wait to see your weird shit.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Wow, that...",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Came out a little disgusting.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"It is a tremendous responsibility, Peter. Only we can remake the universe. Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos and lead it where it needs to go.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,How?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Come with me.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Drax! Drax!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,"Drax, we need to talk -",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"Ugh. I am sorry, but I like a woman with some meat on her bones.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,What?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,I tried to let you down easily by telling you I found you disgusting.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,No! That's not what I -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,What are you doing?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,I'm imagining being with you physically!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,"Drax, that's not - I don't like you like that. I don't even like the type of thing you are.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Hey! There's no need to get personal!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,"Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted. I should have told you earlier, I am stupid. You are in danger.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,What's that?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,You need to readjust the way you process life. Everything around us - including the girl - is temporary. We are forever.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Doesn't eternity get boring?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Not if you have a purpose, Peter. Which is why you're here. I told you how all those years ago I had an unceasing impulse to find life.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I didn't tell you how when I did find it, it was all so... disappointing.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,And that is when I came to a profound realization.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,My innate desire to seek out other life was not so that I could walk among that life.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"Peter, I had found meaning.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I see it. Eternity.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Oh my God.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,We need to get off this planet.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
stan lee,"Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted, that time I was a World War II vet -",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"What the hell you doing, boy?!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,I could tell by how you talked about him - this Ego is bad news. We're here to save Quill.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,For what?  For `honor'? For `love'?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,No! I don't care about those things! I want to save Quill so I can prove I'm better than him! I can lord this over him forever!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,What are you laughing at me for?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,You can fool yourself and everyone else but you can't fool me. I know who you are.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"You don't know anything about me, loser.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,I know everything about you. I know you play like the meanest and the hardest `cause you actually the most scared of all.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Shut up.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"I know you steal batteries you don't need and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you, `cause just a little bit of love reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"I said, shut up.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,I know the scientists what made you never gave a rat's ass about you -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"I'm serious, dude - !",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Just   like my own damn parents, who sold   me, their own little baby, into   slavery! I know who you are, boy,   because you're me.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,What kind of pair are we?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,The kind that's about to go fight a planet I reckon.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"All right, okay, that's - Wait. Fight a what?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Hey!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Who are you people?! What is this place?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,What is she doing here?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,Just watching the fireworks.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"Gamora, let her go!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"The bodies in the caverns, who are they?!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,You are scared.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,I call it the Expansion. It is my purpose. And now it's yours as well.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,It's beautiful.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Over thousands of years I implanted thousands of extensions of myself on thousands of worlds.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,What did she do to me?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,She already told me everything.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I only had one problem. A single Celestial doesn't have enough power for such an enterprise. But two Celestials - well now, that just might do.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,The bodies are his children.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Out of all my labors the most beguiling was attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species. I hoped the result of such a coupling would be enough to power the expansion.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I had Yondu deliver some of them to me. It broke the Ravager code - but I compensated him generously. And, to ease his conscience, I told him I would never hurt them.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"That was true. They never felt a thing. But, one after the other, they failed me. None of them had the Celestial genes. Until you, Peter. Out of all my spawn, only you have carried the connection to the light.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,We need to find Peter now and get off this damn planet.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,Ego will have won him to his side by now. He has a way of -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,Then we just go.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,No. He's our friend.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,All any of you do is yell at each other. You're not friends.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,You're right. We're family. We leave no one behind.  Except maybe you.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,Oh my god.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"For the first time in my life, I am truly not alone.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"What is it, son?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,My friends.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"That's the mortal in you, Peter.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Yes. I don't need that.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,What are we?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Forever.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,What are they?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Temporary.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,You think you love them. But love is merely an evolutionary trick in the service of reproduction. We are beyond such things.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Yes.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,NOW -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,But my mother.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,You said you loved my mother.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"That I did. My river lily, who knew the words to every song that came on the radio. I returned to earth to see her three times. I knew if I came back a fourth, I'd never leave. ",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"The expansion, the reason for my very existence would be over. So I did what I had to do. But it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Wh- what?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,I know that sounds bad -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,Who in the hell do you think you are?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,You killed my mother!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I tried so hard to find the form that best suited you, and this is the thanks I get?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,You really need to grow up.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"I wanted to do this together! But I suppose you'll have to learn by spending the next thousand years as a battery, `Star-Lord'.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Rocket?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Keep that transmitter nearby so I can find you. We're in an old piece of construction equipment Yondu once used to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Ego's unhinged -,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,I know. Get ready.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Drop it, Kraglin!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,I got a plan.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,What is it?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,It's pretty simple.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,NO.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ego,"`My life, my love, my lady is the sea'? Peter, THIS IS THE SEA.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Hey there, Jackass.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,I told you something didn't feel right.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,`I told you so.' That's really what I need right now.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"I came back, didn't I?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Because there's an unspoken thing.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,There is no unspoken thing.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,What are you doing? You could have killed us all crashing in here like that!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Uh, `Thank you, Rocket'?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,We had it under control.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,We did not. That is only an extension of his true self. He will be back soon.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,What's Smurfette doing here!?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"Back rubs, dishes, killing gods, whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,She tried to murder me!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"I saved you, you stupid fox.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,He's not a fox.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,I'm not a raboon either!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"`Raccoon,' whatever!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,How do we kill a Celestial?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"There's the center to him - his brain, his soul, whatever it is, in some sort of shell --",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,It's in the caverns below the surface.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,YONDU?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"If he's got that fin back, I am so screwed.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,Thrusters are out!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid. Otherwise you would have delivered me to this maniac!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"That's what you told me, you old doofus!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Once I figured out what happened to them other kids, I wasn't gonna just hand you over.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,You said you were gonna eat me!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,That was being funny!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Not to me!!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,You people have issues.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Of course I have issues that's my fricking father!!... Thrusters are back up.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,We should be going up!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,We can't. Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it. We have to kill him.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Rocket!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Got it.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"So, we're saving the galaxy again?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I guess.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Awesome. We'll really be able to jack up our prices if we're two- time-galaxy savers.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I seriously can't believe that is where your mind goes.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"It was just a random thought, man! I thought we were friends! ",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Of course I care about the planets, and the buildings, and all of the animals on the planets.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,And the people.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Meh.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,The crabby puppy is so cute he makes me want to die!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,"Your suicidal thoughts sadden me, but your wish will likely come true.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,"Pilots, release envoy units!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,Dive!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,Uhh... Cap'n?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,Cap'n?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,So why'd Ego want you here?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,He needs my genetic connection to the light to help destroy the universe. He tried to teach me how to control the power.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,So could you?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,A little. I made a ball.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,A ball?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"I thought as hard as a could, that's all I could come up with.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,You `thought'?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,You think when I make this arrow fly I use my head?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,What do you use?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Whoa.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,There! Thats Ego's core.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"That ore's thick. Rocket, we're gonna need to use the big laser.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,We must hurry. It will not take Ego long to find us.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Keep it still!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"We drill into the center, we kill him.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"What is it, Kraglin?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
kraglin,"Um, remember that Ayesha chick?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Yeah, why?",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"Aw, hell.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Why aren't you firing the laser?!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,They blew out the generator! I think I packed a small detonator.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,A detonator is worthless without explosives!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,We got these!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Is it strong enough to kill Ego?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"If it is, it will cause a chain reaction throughout his entire nervous system.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Meaning what?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,The entire planet will explode. We'll have to get out of here fast. I rigged a timer.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Go!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,He's coming.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Didn't you say you could make him sleep?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,When he wants! He's too powerful! I can't!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,You don't have to believe in yourself because I believe in you.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,SLEEP!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,I never thought she'd be able to do it. With as skinny and weak as she appears to be.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Mantis,I don't know how long I can hold him!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,"You need to, girl. If you don't keep Ego at bay, we all die.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,The metal is too thick! For the bomb to work we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core. And our fat butts ain't gonna fit through those tiny holes.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Well...,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,That's a terrible idea.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Which is the only kind of idea we got left.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"Unbelievable. `Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that.'",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Uh, what a day.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,"All right. First you flick this switch, then this switch. That activates it. And then you push this button, which will give you five minutes to get out of there. Whatever you do don't push this button, because that will set off the bomb immediately, and we'll all be dead. Now repeat back what I just said.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Uh huh.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,That's right.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,No! That's the button that will kill everyone! Try again.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
groot,I am Groot.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,No! That's exactly what you just said! How is that even possible?! Which button is the button you're supposed to push?! Point to it.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,NO!!!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Hey, you're making him nervous!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Shut up! And give me some tape! Does anyone have any tape out there!? I want to put some tape over the death button!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,I don't have any tape.    Let me check.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Yo, Yondu, do you have any - ow! - do you have any tape?!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,No one has any tape.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,Not a single person has tape?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag! If anyone had tape it would be you!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,That's exactly my point! I have to do everything!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,"Dude, you're wasting time!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Rocket Raccoon,We're all gonna die.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,We're done for without the generator.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,Guardians! Perhaps it will provide you solace that your deaths are not without purpose.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,They will serve as a warning to all of those tempted with betraying us; don't screw with the Sovereign.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,This is gonna hurt.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Nebula,"Promises, promises.",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,Hey!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,NO!!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
ayesha,NO! NOOOOO!!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,We're gonna blow!,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Gamora,Peter?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,What?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,You look like Mary Poppins.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,Is he cool?,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Yeah. He's cool.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Yondu,"I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!",guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,Oh. Wow.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Drax,She's just unconscious.,guardians_galaxy_vol2
Peter Quill,How long before the bomb goes off?,guardians_galaxy_vol2

Nick Fury,At this end?,avengers
Clint Barton,"Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides. DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends of the facility. The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL. A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding everyone. The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform. SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI. Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.",avengers
Nick Fury,"Sir, please put down the spear! Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss Loki's fired shot. ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the platform and ATTACKS those firing at him. In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost gone to shit. Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.",avengers
Loki,"You have heart. Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands straight. As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract, placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...",avengers

Tony Stark,Security breach.,avengers
Pepper Potts,Phil! Come in.,avengers
Tony Stark,"Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.",avengers
Pepper Potts,"Come on in, we're celebrating.",avengers
Tony Stark,Which is why he can't stay.,avengers
stark),Soon as possible.,avengers
Tony Stark,I don't like being handed things.,avengers
Pepper Potts,"That's alright, `cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade. She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and passes the file over to Stark.",avengers
Pepper Potts,Thank you.,avengers
Tony Stark,Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.,avengers
Pepper Potts,Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about.,avengers
Tony Stark,"The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify.",avengers
Pepper Potts,I didn't know that either.,avengers
Tony Stark,"Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others.",avengers
Pepper Potts,That I did know.,avengers
Tony Stark,"Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases.",avengers
Tony Stark,"You know, I thought we were having a moment.",avengers
Pepper Potts,"I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken.",avengers
Tony Stark,How did you notice? Why is he Phil?,avengers
Pepper Potts,What is all of this?,avengers
Tony Stark,"This is, uh... Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and Pepper.",avengers
Tony Stark,"This. Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS",avengers
Pepper Potts,I'm going to take the jet to D.C. tonight.,avengers
Tony Stark,Tomorrow.,avengers
Pepper Potts,You've got homework. You've got a lot of homework.,avengers
Tony Stark,"Well, what if I didn't?",avengers
Pepper Potts,If you didn't?,avengers
Tony Stark,Yeah.,avengers
Pepper Potts,"You mean if you finished?  Well, um...then... She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks away in embarrassment.",avengers
Tony Stark,Square deal. It's the last date. Pepper kisses him.,avengers
Pepper Potts,"Work hard. As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in holograph form, worried.",avengers
pilot,"We're about forty minutes out from base, sir. Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.",avengers
Steve Rogers,"So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?",avengers
Steve Rogers,"Didn't really go his way, did it?",avengers
Steve Rogers,"Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.",avengers
Steve Rogers,The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned?,avengers
the other,The Chitauri grow restless.,avengers
Loki,Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle.,avengers
the other,Battle? Against the meager might of Earth?,avengers
Loki,"Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim.",avengers
the other,"You question us? You question HIM? He, who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated?",avengers
Loki,I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard! Betrayed!,avengers
the other,"Your ambition is little, born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.",avengers
Loki,"You don't have the Tesseract yet. THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter.",avengers
Loki,"I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words.",avengers
the other,"You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he can't find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain. THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.",avengers
Steve Rogers,Ma'am?,avengers
Natasha Romanov,Hi.,avengers
Natasha Romanov,"There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?",avengers
Steve Rogers,Trading cards?,avengers
Natasha Romanov,"They're vintage, he's very proud. Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in hisway.",avengers
Steve Rogers,Dr. Banner. Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.,avengers
Bruce Banner,"Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming.",avengers
Steve Rogers,Word is you can find the cube.,avengers
Bruce Banner,Is that the only word on me?,avengers
Steve Rogers,Only word I care about.,avengers
Bruce Banner,"Must be e for you, all of this.",avengers
Steve Rogers,"Well, this is actually kind of familiar.",avengers
Natasha Romanov,"Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath. Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly ""sail.""",avengers
Steve Rogers,Is this is a submarine?,avengers
Bruce Banner,Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container? They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE,avengers
Nick Fury,Good. Let's vanish.,avengers
Nick Fury,"Gentlemen. Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.",avengers
Nick Fury,"Doctor, thank you for coming.",avengers
Bruce Banner,"Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying?",avengers
Nick Fury,"Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.",avengers
Bruce Banner,"Where are you with that? Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.",avengers
Natasha Romanov,That's still not gonna find them in time.,avengers
Bruce Banner,You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to?,avengers
Nick Fury,How many are there?,avengers
Bruce Banner,"Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?",avengers
Nick Fury,"Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please. Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.",avengers
Natasha Romanov,"You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.",avengers
selvig,Put it over there!,avengers
Clint Barton,"SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor. He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM.",avengers
Clint Barton,Is this the stuff you need?,avengers
selvig,"Yeah, iridium. It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's very hard to get hold of.",avengers
Clint Barton,Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.,avengers
selvig,"Well, I didn't know!  Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so much. It's more than just knowledge, it's... truth.",avengers
Loki,"I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?",avengers
Clint Barton,My next target.,avengers
Loki,Tell me what you need.,avengers
Clint Barton,I'll need a distraction.  And an eyeball.,avengers
Steve Rogers,"No, no. It's fine.",avengers
Nick Fury,"Captain, you're up. Steve nods. Leaves.",avengers
thwack!,He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an ARROW. He raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building. Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye scanner instrument.,avengers
screen.,"The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium.",avengers
Loki,"Kneel before me. The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd. Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their spears, encircling the crowd.",avengers
Loki,"I said. KNEEL!!! Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing his arms out, smiling.",avengers
Loki,"Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel. As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.",avengers
Loki,There are no men like me.,avengers
Loki,"Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.",avengers
captain america,"You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.",avengers
captain america,"I'm not the one who's out of time. From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed towards Loki.",avengers
Natasha Romanov,"Loki, drop the weapon and stand down. Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT. Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's tip on his helmet.",avengers
Loki,Kneel.,avengers
captain america,Not today! Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and FLIPS him over.,avengers
Natasha Romanov,"The guy's all over the place. Suddenly, AC/DC's ""Shoot to Thrill"" overdrives the QUINJET'S speakers.",avengers
Tony Stark,"Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry the suit has.",avengers
Tony Stark,"Make your move, Reindeer Games. Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes away.",avengers
Tony Stark,Good move.,avengers
captain america,Mr. Stark.,avengers
Tony Stark,Captain.,avengers
Nick Fury,Said anything?,avengers
Natasha Romanov,Not a word.,avengers
Nick Fury,"Just get him here. We're low on time. With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering.",avengers
Steve Rogers,I don't like it.,avengers
Tony Stark,What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?,avengers
Steve Rogers,I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.,avengers
Tony Stark,"Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?",avengers
Steve Rogers,What?,avengers
Tony Stark,"It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle. Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.",avengers
Steve Rogers,Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.,avengers
Tony Stark,"Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you. THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake violently.",avengers
Natasha Romanov,Where's this coming from? Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.,avengers
Steve Rogers,What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?,avengers
Loki,I'm not overly fond of what follows. What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet. Not a light. A King. THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony puts the IRON MAN helmet on.,avengers
Tony Stark,Now there's that guy.,avengers
Natasha Romanov,Another Asgardian?,avengers
captain america,Think the guy's a friendly?,avengers
Tony Stark,"Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor.",avengers
captain america,"Stark, we need a plan of attack!",avengers
Tony Stark,I have a plan. Attack. IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a parachute to follow.,avengers
Natasha Romanov,"I'd sit this one out, Cap.",avengers
captain america,I don't see how I can.,avengers
Natasha Romanov,"These guys come from legends, they're basically gods.",avengers
captain america,"There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that. Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.",avengers
Thor,Where is the Tesseract?,avengers
Thor,Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!,avengers
Loki,"Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth. Thor drops MJÖLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up Loki. His brother. Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is everything to a man or god.",avengers
Thor,I thought you dead.,avengers
Loki,Did you mourn?,avengers
Thor,We all did. Our father...,avengers
Loki,"Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even bigger wedge between them.",avengers
Thor,"We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?",avengers
Thor,"So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights. No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki.",avengers
Thor,You think yourself above them.,avengers
Loki,"Well, yes.",avengers
Thor,"Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill. Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up to the ledge. Turns around.",avengers
Loki,"I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it...",avengers
Thor,Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?,avengers
Loki,I am a king!,avengers
Thor,Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home.,avengers
Loki,"I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where. Mjölnir flies back to his grasp.",avengers
Thor,"You listen well, brother. I...",avengers
Loki,I'm listening.,avengers
Thor,Do not touch me again!,avengers
Tony Stark,Then don't take my stuff.,avengers
Thor,You have no idea what you're dealing with.,avengers
Tony Stark,Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?,avengers
Thor,"This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice!",avengers
Tony Stark,"He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist. The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree.",avengers
Tony Stark,"Okay. From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch! Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjölnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.",avengers
jarvis,Power at 400% capacity.,avengers
Tony Stark,"How about that? IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.",avengers
captain america,"Hey! That's enough!  Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.",avengers
Thor,I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes!,avengers
captain america,Then prove it! Put the hammer down.,avengers
Tony Stark,"Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer!",avengers
captain america,Are we done here?,avengers
Nick Fury,"In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass. Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass. Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit his pants. Not a god, though.",avengers
Nick Fury,"Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?! Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.",avengers
Nick Fury,Ant. Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel trap.,avengers
Nick Fury,Boot.,avengers
Nick Fury,Built for something a lot stronger than you.,avengers
Loki,"Oh, I've heard. Loki looks into the camera.",avengers
Loki,"The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man. How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you?",avengers
Nick Fury,How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control.,avengers
Nick Fury,You talk about peace and you kill `cause it's fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did.,avengers
Loki,"Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is.",avengers
Bruce Banner,"He really grows on you, doesn't he?",avengers
Steve Rogers,"Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what's his play?",avengers
Bruce Banner,So he's building another portal. That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.,avengers
Thor,Selvig?,avengers
Bruce Banner,He's an astrophysicist.,avengers
Thor,He's a friend.,avengers
Natasha Romanov,"Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours.",avengers
Steve Rogers,I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He's not leading an army from here.,avengers
Bruce Banner,"I don't think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.",avengers
Thor,"Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother.",avengers
Natasha Romanov,He killed eighty people in two days.,avengers
Thor,He's adopted.,avengers
Bruce Banner,"Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?",avengers
Tony Stark,It's a stabilizing agent. (walks in with Coulson; to,avengers
Phil Coulson,"I'll fly you there. Keep the love alive. Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.",avengers
around),How does Fury do this?,avengers
Tony Stark,"Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.",avengers
Tony Stark,"Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?",avengers
Steve Rogers,Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?,avengers
Bruce Banner,He's got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.,avengers
Tony Stark,"Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.",avengers
Bruce Banner,"Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.",avengers
Tony Stark,"Finally, someone who speaks English.",avengers
Steve Rogers,Is that what just happened? Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as the mutual respect for each other shows.,avengers
Tony Stark,"It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.",avengers
Steve Rogers,"Let's start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.",avengers
Nick Fury,"I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.",avengers
Thor,Monkeys? I do not understand.,avengers
Steve Rogers,"I do! I understood that reference. Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.",avengers
Tony Stark,"Shall we play, doctor?",avengers
Bruce Banner,"Let's play some. As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing.",avengers
Bruce Banner,The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process.,avengers
Tony Stark,"If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.",avengers
Bruce Banner,All I packed was a tooth brush.,avengers
Bruce Banner,"Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.",avengers
Tony Stark,"Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises. Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD. Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.",avengers
ow!,Tony looks at Banner closely.,avengers
Tony Stark,Nothing?,avengers
Tony Stark,"You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?",avengers
Steve Rogers,Is everything a joke to you?,avengers
Tony Stark,Funny things are.,avengers
Steve Rogers,"Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny. No offense, doctor.",avengers
Bruce Banner,"No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things.",avengers
Tony Stark,"You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut.",avengers
Steve Rogers,"And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.",avengers
Tony Stark,You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.,avengers
Steve Rogers,You think Fury's hiding something?,avengers
Tony Stark,"He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets.  It's bugging him too, isn't it?",avengers
Bruce Banner,Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and...,avengers
Steve Rogers,Doctor? A beat.,avengers
Bruce Banner,"'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.",avengers
Steve Rogers,I heard it.,avengers
Bruce Banner,"Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news.",avengers
Steve Rogers,The Stark Tower? That big ugly  ...building in New York?,avengers
Bruce Banner,"It's powered by Stark Reactors, self- sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for what, a year?",avengers
Tony Stark,That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.,avengers
Bruce Banner,"So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?",avengers
Tony Stark,I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.,avengers
Steve Rogers,"I'm sorry, did you say...?",avengers
Tony Stark,Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.  Blueberry?,avengers
Steve Rogers,Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?,avengers
Tony Stark,"An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible.",avengers
Steve Rogers,"I think Loki's trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them.",avengers
Tony Stark,Following is not really my style.,avengers
Tony Stark,"Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?",avengers
Bruce Banner,"Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off.",avengers
Steve Rogers,"Just find the cube. Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility, he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.",avengers
Tony Stark,That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.,avengers
Bruce Banner,The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us.,avengers
Tony Stark,What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.,avengers
Tony Stark,"It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does.",avengers
Bruce Banner,And I'll read all about it.,avengers
Tony Stark,Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.,avengers
Bruce Banner,"Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare.",avengers
Tony Stark,"You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege.",avengers
Bruce Banner,But you can control it.,avengers
Tony Stark,Because I learned how.,avengers
Bruce Banner,"It's different. Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.",avengers
Tony Stark,"Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you.",avengers
Bruce Banner,So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life?,avengers
Bruce Banner,That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?,avengers
Bruce Banner,You might not like that.,avengers
Tony Stark,You just might.,avengers
Thor,Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he's done. Erik is a good man.,avengers
Thor,"They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we...we come here battling like BILCHSTEIM.",avengers
Thor,"BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big antlers. You don't have those?",avengers
Thor,"They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path. Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come.",avengers
Thor,"When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war.",avengers
Nick Fury,War hasn't started yet.,avengers
Thor,"I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain that would prize his need from him.",avengers
Nick Fury,"A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.",avengers
Thor,What are you asking me to do?,avengers
Nick Fury,I'm asking. What are you prepared to do?,avengers
Thor,Loki is a prisoner.,avengers
Nick Fury,Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here? Thor doesn't answer.,avengers
Loki,There's not many people that can sneak up on me. (turns to see NATASHA,avengers
Natasha Romanov,But you figured I'd come.,avengers
Loki,"After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate.",avengers
Natasha Romanov,I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton.,avengers
Loki,I'd say I've expanded his mind.,avengers
Natasha Romanov,And once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain. What happens to his mind?,avengers
Loki,"Is this love, Agent Romanoff?",avengers
Natasha Romanov,Love is for children. I owe him a debt.,avengers
Natasha Romanov,(she pulls up a chair as,avengers
well),"Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh...well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skillset. I didn't care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call.",avengers
Loki,And what will you do if I vow to spare him?,avengers
Natasha Romanov,Not let you out.,avengers
Natasha Romanov,"Regimes fall every day. I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.",avengers
Loki,What is it you want?,avengers
Natasha Romanov,"It's really not that complicated. I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.",avengers
Loki,"Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SÃO PAULO? THE HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything?",avengers
intercuts,- Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.,avengers
Loki,You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers. - Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury oversees.,avengers
Loki,"You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away! - Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF",avengers
Loki,"I won't touch Barton. Not until I make him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In every way he knows you fear! And when he'll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams, I'll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim! NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.",avengers
Natasha Romanov,"So, Banner... that's your play.",avengers
Tony Stark,Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you.,avengers
Nick Fury,You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.,avengers

Tony Stark,"And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of SECRET FILES) What is PHASE 2? Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.",avengers
Steve Rogers,PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons.,avengers
Nick Fury,"Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're...",avengers

Bruce Banner,Did you know about this?,avengers
Natasha Romanov,"You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?",avengers
Bruce Banner,"I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.",avengers

Bruce Banner,And you've been doing what exactly?,avengers
Natasha Romanov,You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.,avengers
Bruce Banner,"Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.",avengers
Nick Fury,Because of him. ,avengers

Thor,My people want nothing but peace with your planet.,avengers
Nick Fury,"But you're not the only people out there, are you? And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled.",avengers
Steve Rogers,Like you controlled the cube?,avengers
Thor,"You're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war.",avengers
Steve Rogers,A higher form?,avengers
Nick Fury,You forced our hand. We had to come up with something.,avengers
Tony Stark,Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down.,avengers

Tony Stark,I think I would just cut the wire.,avengers

Tony Stark,I can get there faster.,avengers

Steve Rogers,"Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.",captain_america_civil_war

sharon carter,"She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related.",captain_america_civil_war
sharon carter,"I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move… it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say "" No, you move.""",captain_america_civil_war

My father… still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried.

And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do.

BETTY We’re all a lot further along than we were then, but Sterns is way out in front on that score. He had some kind of ethics cloud around him at Cal Tech but it didn’t stop him. His work is unbelievably brilliant. So, Brazil for the corablanca? BRUCE He’s synthesizing it but I had to try to get it at the source. It took a long time just to get there. And I couldn’t get a thousandth of what I’d need. If he’s even right... And now? BETTY BRUCE I go find him, I suppose. I don’t know if he’s really got something and it’s a much longer shot without the data but I’ve got to risk it... BETTY No, you don’t. She gets up and goes to a bookshelf with a vase on it. She shakes out a small DATA/FLASHCARD on ring, with a lanyard. She goes back and hands it to him. BETTY I got in there before they carted it all away. I hoped it would tell us something someday. BRUCE Does the General know you have this? BETTY I don’t think so.",the_incredible_hulk
Bruce Banner,"He was there in Brazil. When they came for me. I saw him. BETTY Oh my god...he’s crazier than anybody knows. I’m so sorry... How? BRUCE I’ve twisted it round every possible way. Is there anyway it could have been Sterns? BETTY I hear he’s a total anarchist. Hates authority. Doesn’t think he should answer to anybody. That’s why he got in trouble. Bruce, why didn’t you...?",the_incredible_hulk
Sam Wilson,"...and I said “Miss So-and-so, I’ve been analyzing your ‘condition’ for nearly three months and I think I can say conclusively that your issues are more Caffeinated-UnCaffeinated than Manic- Depressive... They all laugh, even Banner chuckles. BETTY ...You’re not so much Multiple Personality as Spoiled Brat... BANNER Your problem isn’t ADD so much as laziness. BETTY It makes you sound cruel. But Samson takes a few of these to pay for all the free work he does. SAMSON Pro-whiners to pay for the pro-bono... SAMSON",the_incredible_hulk
Bruce Banner,"I’m so sorry. It’s been a long time since I felt...light...about anything. BETTY It’s alright...you’re with friends. All say good night. Bruce shakes Samson’s hand. BRUCE Good night. SAMSON Sleep well. Samson heads for their bedroom. Betty walks Bruce to the spare room. The moment is bittersweet. BETTY Do you need anything? BRUCE No. I should go early tomorrow. If I can borrow cash from you, I’ll take the bus. BETTY Of course. I’ll drive you out to the station. It’s hard for her to leave him alone, awkward. He looks so tired and lonely. But she finally turns. Betty shuts the door and dissolves, crying hard, silently, stifling it. She enters. He can see that she’s cried and comes to her. She hugs him hard BETTY Thank you.",the_incredible_hulk
Bruce Banner,"Hey... Samson jumps badly...he didn’t hear Bruce... SAMSON Good lord, you scared me... He sits on the couch and Banner sits in the chair opposite him. SAMSON I thought it might be easier for all of us...Want some wine? I’m having a lot. They both start to laugh because there's no getting around it all. He drains his glass, fills it and gives it to Bruce and keeps the bottle. They talk in low tones... BANNER You’re been incredibly generous. I’m very sorry to have...dropped in like this. SAMSON I think I read a Raymond Carver story about a situation like this once... ",the_incredible_hulk
Sam Wilson,"I seem to remember thinking there was a lesson in it but it eludes me at the moment. So much for the insights of literature. BANNER Whatever you may think, I didn’t come here to see Betty... SAMSON Then why did you come? BANNER I have a problem...I thought part of the solution might be here. SAMSON Cryptic. But I’ll take it at face value.",the_incredible_hulk
Bruce Banner,There are...aspects of my personality that I can’t control. And I hurt Betty...in ways I will never forgive myself for.,the_incredible_hulk
Sam Wilson,"You don’t drop your career and fall off the face of the earth for five years because you’ve got an anger management issue, Bruce. You see a shrink. BANNER It’s a little more complicated than that. Samson, I’ve been alone for a long time now. I have to be. The toughest part of it is that I worry about what I’ve done to Betty. If she’s happy and you’re a part of that, then that makes me very happy. Honestly. The last thing I want to do is cause any trouble for her...or for you. I’d kill myself before I’d hurt her again. SAMSON Totally honest and yet avoiding something. Exactly like her. Bruce pulling his sweatshirt on, stepping into the hall. He can hear Betty and Samson in the kitchen. Talking in low tones... barely hears.... SAMSON Just promise me you’ll come straight home... Betty steps out into the living room, Samson behind her. Ready? BETTY BANNER Stop a second... She pulls the car over. Banner gets out of the car and steps up onto the grass and across the walking paths to a spot with a tree and bench and a view of the buildings and lawns. Betty moves next to him.",the_incredible_hulk
Bruce Banner,"What were we doing here? I mean what were we really trying to accomplish? Do you ever ask yourself that? BETTY We were trying to...understand. Crack a puzzle. Advance things a little. BANNER I think that’s what we told ourselves. At least the General was honest about what he wanted out of it. I don’t think we were as honest. BETTY No, you’ve turned this on yourself too hard. We did talk about it and we were all comfortable. The worst you can say is that you rushed it...but you took your own risks, you didn’t ask anybody else too. BANNER But it wasn’t me that died. BETTY Nobody thought something like that was possible... BANNER I don’t know...Nature took a long time to build us like we are...this whole delicate wonderfully sophisticated system refined over billions of years. We come in and monkey with it...think we can improve it overnight. Sooner or later it’s going to blow up in our face... Thunder rumbles in the distance... a summer storm.

Betty starting to run toward the direction they saw the soldiers. MORE SOLDIERS coming into view, sweeping across the grounds between the buildings heading in the direction Bruce went. In the distance, through the campus complex on the road on the far side she sees FOUR HUMVEES jumping off the road and heading the same way along the opposite perimeter of the campus.

Wong,"You might have a gift for the mystic arts, but you still have much to learn. Word of the Ancient One’s death will spread through the Multiverse. Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it. We must be ready.",dr_e
Steven Strange,We’ll be ready.,dr_strange
Thor,"So, Earth has wizards now, huh? Tea?",dr_e
Thor,"That's a long story. A family drama, that kind of thing, but… we’re looking for my father.",dr_e
doctor e,"Oh, okay. So, if you’ve found Odin, you all will return to Asgard, probably?",dr_strange
Thor,"Oh, yes. Probably.",dr_e
doctor e,Alright. Let me help you.,dr_strange
jonathan,Can I help you?,dr_e
karl mordo,They carried you into Kamar-Taj on a strecher. Look at you now. Pangborn.,dr_e
jonathan,"Mordo. So, what can I do for you? Man!",dr_e
karl mordo,"You been away many months now and I heard a revelation. The true purpose of a sorcerer is to twist things out of there proper shape. Stealing power, providing nature… like you.",dr_e
jonathan,I stolen nothing. This is my power. Mine.,dr_e
karl mordo,Power… has a purpose.,dr_e
jonathan,Why you doing this?,dr_e
karl mordo,Because I see it long last was wrong with the world. Too many sorcerers.,dr_e
Thor,"Now I know what you're thinking. Oh no! Thor's in a cage. How did this happen?  Well, sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody. It's a long story but basically I'm a bit of a hero. See, I spent some time on earth, fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things... didn't find any. That's when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage... where I met you.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,How much longer do you think we'll be here?,thor_ragnarok
surtur,"Thor, Son of Odin.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Surtur. Son of a bitch...you're still alive! I thought my father killed you, like, half a million years ago.",thor_ragnarok
surtur,I cannot die. Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"You know, it's funny you should mention that because I've been having these terrible dreams of late. Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and you Surtur are at the center of all of them.",thor_ragnarok
surtur,"Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard. The great prophecy--",thor_ragnarok
Thor,Hang on.   Hang on.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,I'll be back around shortly. I really feel like we were connecting there.,thor_ragnarok

Thor,"Oh, hang on. Give it a second.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"I swear I'm not even moving, it's just doing this on its own. I'm really sorry.  Okay, let me get this straight. You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame, and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house--",thor_ragnarok
surtur,A mountain!,thor_ragnarok
Thor,The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?,thor_ragnarok
surtur,Odin is not on Asgard. And your absence has left the throne defenseless.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Okay, so where is it? This crown?",thor_ragnarok
surtur,"This is my Crown, the source of my power.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Oh, that's a crown? I thought it was a big eyebrow.",thor_ragnarok
surtur,It's a crown. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   4.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head.",thor_ragnarok
surtur,"But Ragnarok has   already begun. You cannot stop it.    I am Asgard's doom, and so are   you. All will suffer, all will   burn.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"That's intense. To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle. But it looks like I'm going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains, knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard's vault.",thor_ragnarok
surtur,You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Because that's what heroes do.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Wait, sorry. I didn't time that right.  And, now!",thor_ragnarok

Thor,...Heimdall?,thor_ragnarok
skurge,"Heimdall was an idiot. This job should have made him rich. Now, the job ain't easy, but it does have its benefits. The Bi-Frost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms have to offer. I mean it's all mine for the taking.  Behold...my stuff.",thor_ragnarok
skurge,"I'm particularly fond of these. I pulled `em out of a place on Midgard called Texas. I even named them. Des and Troy. You see, when you put them together...they destroy.",thor_ragnarok

skurge,"That traitor. No one knows, he's a fugitive of the throne.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,Traitor?,thor_ragnarok
skurge,"Yeah, you see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty, but he disappeared before the trial. Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the Universe.",thor_ragnarok

Bruce Banner,Who's that?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,He kind of runs the place. You actually lived in his house.,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,I did?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Yeah. Quite a lot's happened. You and I had a fight recently.,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,Did I win?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"No, I won. Easily.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,Doesn't sound right.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Well, it's true.",thor_ragnarok
grandmaster,It seems that that criminally seductive Lord of Thunder has stolen him away. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                    77.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Seductive GOD of Thunder.    We need to move.,thor_ragnarok

grandmaster,"Why are you handing me the melt stick? He was interrupting. That's not a capital violation.  My precious champion has come up missing and its all because of that Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him.  YOUR brother. Whatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated. I'm sure there's a big history.  And YOUR contender.",thor_ragnarok
Loki,"My dear friend, if you were to give me twelve hours I could bring them both back to you.",thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,I can do it in two.,thor_ragnarok
Loki,I could do it in one.,thor_ragnarok
grandmaster,"You know what? I woke up this morning thinking about a public execution. But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little ""who's gonna get him first?"" So you're on the clock.",thor_ragnarok
Loki,What have you done!?,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,"I don't answer to you, lackey.",thor_ragnarok
Loki,It's Loki. And you will answer to the Grandmaster. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  79.,thor_ragnarok
Loki,Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?,thor_ragnarok

Loki,You're a Valkyrie. I thought the Valkyrie all died gruesome deaths?,thor_ragnarok

Thor,The sun's going down. It's getting really low. The sun's going down. It's getting real low.,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,Would you stop saying that!?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,I just need you to stay calm.,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,Calm!?   I'm on an alien planet!,thor_ragnarok
Thor,It's just a planet.   You've been on a planet before.,thor_ragnarok

Bruce Banner,"My neurons, they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information.  BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16       81.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,"The whole thing is totally different this time.  In the past, I always felt like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel, but this time it's like he had the keys and I was locked in the trunk.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Alright, well, you're back now, that's all that matters.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,"No, it's not what matters. What I'm trying to tell you, is that if I turn into the Hulk again, Banner may never come back. And we're stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"We're not stranded, I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,Thank you.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Not your home, though.   Asgard.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,What?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Listen, my people are in great danger. You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being who also happens to be my sister.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,"Okay, that is so wrong on so many... I don't wanna fight your sister. That's a family issue.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"No, she's an evil being.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,I don't care what she is.   I'm not fighting any more beings.   I'm sick of it. I just told you.  BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16             82.,thor_ragnarok

Bruce Banner,"Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,What?   No!,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,It's gross. You don't care about me. You're not my friend.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"No! I don't even like the Hulk. He's all like... ""smash, smash, smash."" I prefer you.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,Thanks.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"But if I'm being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings, he is very powerful and useful.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,"Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,Is he though?,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero. How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Fine, you don't have to fight anyone. But we're in danger here, so we have to move.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,What are you doing with that? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                83.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,I need a disguise.    I'm a fugitive.,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,I need a disguise.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,You are the disguise.,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,I'll be Tony Stark.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,What?,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,Yeah.   Tony and the gypsy.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"No, no you're not Tony.    You're Bruce Banner.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,Then why did you dress me up like Tony?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Because you were naked.,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,"Okay, I'll give you that.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,What are you doing?    Stop doing that!,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,Tony wears his pants super tight!,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Why are you being so weird?,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,I don't know. Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years inside of a monster made me a little weird.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Hey. It's okay. You're good. Calm down. Come on. Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard and you're not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again. All right?",thor_ragnarok

Thor,That's good. What are you doing here?,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,What are you doing here?   I thought you were leaving.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,I got sidetracked.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,What's with the...,thor_ragnarok
Thor,It's my disguise.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,But I can see your face.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Not when I do this, you can't.  Your hair looks nice. I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,What are those things on her eyes? Are those the people that she's killed? She's so beautiful and strong...,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,Who is this guy? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16            86.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,He's a friend.,thor_ragnarok

valkyrie,I feel like I know you.,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,I feel like I know you too.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,"Look, I've spent years in a haze trying to forget my past. Sakaaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"I was thinking that you drink too much, and that probably was going to kill you.",thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,"I don't plan to stop drinking, but I don't want to forget. I can't turn away anymore. So, if I'm donna to die, well... it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,Good.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,Yeah. So I'm saying that I wanna be on the team. Has it got a name?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Yeah, it's called the Revengers. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16               87.",thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,Revengers?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge.  Do you want revenge?,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,I'm undecided.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Okay.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,"Also, I've got a peace offering.",thor_ragnarok
Loki,Surprise.,thor_ragnarok
Loki,OW!,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Just had to be sure.,thor_ragnarok
Loki,"Hello, Bruce.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,"So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody. Where are you at these days?",thor_ragnarok
Loki,It varies from moment to moment.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Is that... a Dragonfang?,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,It is.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,My God. This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems. Our best bet is a wormhole just outside the city limits.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,Refuel on Xandar and be back in Asgard in around 18 months.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Nope. We're going through that one.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,The Devil's Anus?,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,"Wait, whose anus are we going through?",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of an Einstein- Rosen Bridge.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,We need another ship.   That would tear mine to pieces.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,She's right. We need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   89.,thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,And has an offline power steering system that could also function without the on-board computer.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,"And we need one with cup holders, because we're gonna die. So, drinks!",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,Do I know you? I feel like I know you.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,"I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"What do you say, doctor? Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway. Talk about an adventure.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,We need a ship.                 Need a ship.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,"There are one or two ships, absolute top-of-the-line models--",thor_ragnarok
Loki,"I don't mean to impose, but the Grandmaster has a great many ships. I may eve have stolen the access codes to his security system.",thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,And suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing.,thor_ragnarok
Loki,"Heavens, no. I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster.  BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16        90.",thor_ragnarok
Loki,And in exchange for codes and access to a ship I'm asking for safe passage...through the anus.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,You're telling us you can get us access into the garage without setting off any alarms?,thor_ragnarok
Loki,"Yes, brother. I can.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,"Okay, can I just... A quick FYI, I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago and he was totally ready to kill any of us.",thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,He did try to kill me.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Yes, me too. On many, many occasions. There was one time when we were children, he transformed himself into a snake, and he knows that I love snakes. So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it and he transformed back into himself and he was like, ""Yeah, it's me!"" And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.",thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,"If we're boosting a ship, we're gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.",thor_ragnarok
Loki,Why not set the beast loose?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Shut up.,thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,You guys have a beast?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"No, there's no beast. He's just being stupid. We're going to start a revolution. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  91.",thor_ragnarok
Bruce Banner,Revolution?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,I'll explain later.,thor_ragnarok

Thor,I'll explain later.,thor_ragnarok
korg,"Is that some sort of protoplasm, all the stuff that's coming out of you? Or are they eggs? Looks like eggs.",thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,I'm looking for Korg.,thor_ragnarok
korg,"Who's asking? I know you're asking. Is anyone else asking, or is it just you?",thor_ragnarok
valkyrie,The Lord of Thunder sends his best.,thor_ragnarok

topaz,Mainframe?,thor_ragnarok
grandmaster,"No. Why would I not like ""mainframe?"" No, the ""S"" word.",thor_ragnarok

grandmaster,"Okay, that's better.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Hey, so listen, we should talk.",thor_ragnarok
Loki,I disagree. Open communication was never our family's forte.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,You have no idea. I've had quite the revelation since we spoke last.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,Hello!,thor_ragnarok
Loki,Hi!,thor_ragnarok
Loki,"Odin brought us together, it's almost poetic that his death should split us apart. We might as well be ers now. ""Two sons of the crown"" set adrift.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,Thought you didn't want to talk about it?,thor_ragnarok
Loki,Here's the thing. I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,That's exactly what I was thinking.,thor_ragnarok
Loki,...Did you just agree with me?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"This place is perfect for you. It's savage, chaotic, lawless. Brother, you're going to do GREAT here.",thor_ragnarok
Loki,Do you truly think so little of me?,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever. But, at the end of the day, you're you, I'm me...  BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16               94.",thor_ragnarok

Thor,Which one's the ship she told us to get?,thor_ragnarok
Loki,The Commodore.,thor_ragnarok

Thor,"Oh, Loki.",thor_ragnarok
Loki,"I know I've betrayed you many times before, but this time it's truly nothing personal. The reward for your capture will set me up nicely.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Never one for sentiment, were you?",thor_ragnarok
Loki,Easier to let it burn.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,I agree.,thor_ragnarok
Thor,"Oh brother, you're becoming predictable. I trust you, you betray me. Round and round in circles we go.",thor_ragnarok
Thor,"See, Loki, life is about, it's about growth. It's about change. But you seem to just wanna stay the same.

Tony Stark,Been a while since I was up here in front of you. Maybe I’ll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards. There’s been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Yes,iron_man_2
christine (v.o.),And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I know that it’s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I’m a superhero.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I mean, let’s face it, I’m not the heroric type. A laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I’ve made, largely public. The truth is… I am Iron Man.",iron_man_2

Tony Stark,It’s good to be back. You missed me?,iron_man_2
man in crowd,Blow something up!,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I’m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I’m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I’m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven’t come across anyone who’s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.",iron_man_2
woman in crowd,I love you Tony!,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Please, it’s not about me. [People still cheering Tony] It’s not about you. It’s not even about us. It’s about legacy. It’s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that’s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It’s not about us. Therefore, what I’m saying, if I’m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo.

woman,Call me.,iron_man_2

Tony Stark,[signing a picture of Iron Man] Hello. It would be a pleasure.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,Okay,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[what would be ruffling the hair of a small boy if said small boy were not wearing an Iron Man helmet making hair unreachable] See you buddy,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,This is Larry.,iron_man_2

Tony Stark,Very mellow.,iron_man_2

Tony Stark,"No, it was perfect.",iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,"Look what we got here, the new model.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Hey, does she come with the car?",iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,I certainly hope so. Hi.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Hi. And you are?,iron_man_2
woman,Marshal.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Irish. I like it.,iron_man_2
marshal,Pleased to meet you Tony.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?,iron_man_2
marshal,Bedford.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,What are you doing here?,iron_man_2
marshal,Looking for you.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?,iron_man_2
marshal,Serving subpoenas. [Hands him a letter. Tony doesn’t take it],iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Yikes.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,[Reaching over and taking the letter] He doesn’t like to be handed things.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Yeah, I have a peeve.",iron_man_2
marshal,I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Can I see a badge?,iron_man_2
marshal,You wanna see the badge?,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,He likes the badge.,iron_man_2
marshal,[showing him her badge.] You still like it?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Yep. [Starts engine] How far are we from D.C.?,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,D.C.? 250 miles.,iron_man_2
senator stern,"Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[turns around from where he was trying to talk to Pepper who looks like she was trying to tell him off.] Yes dear?,iron_man_2
senator stern,Can I have your attention?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Absolutely.,iron_man_2
stern,Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I do not.,iron_man_2
stern,You do not?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.",iron_man_2
stern,The Iron Man weapon.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,My device does not fit that description.,iron_man_2
stern,Well… How would you describe it?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.",iron_man_2
stern,As?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.,iron_man_2
stern,"It’s a weapon. It’s a weapon, Mr Stark.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…",iron_man_2
stern,My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it.",iron_man_2
stern,"Look, I’m no expert…",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.,iron_man_2
stern,"I’m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I’d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.",iron_man_2
justin hammer,"Absolutely. I’m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You’re the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let’s just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we’re here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it’s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I’d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain’t Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America.",iron_man_2
stern,That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Rhodey? What?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Hey, buddy. I didn’t expect to see you here.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Look, it’s me, I’m here. Deal with it. Let’s move on.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I just…,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Drop it.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"All right, I’ll drop it.",iron_man_2
stern,"I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?",iron_man_2
Rhodey,"You’re requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?",iron_man_2
stern,"Yes, sir.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.,iron_man_2
stern,I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read…,iron_man_2
Rhodey,You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final…,iron_man_2
stern,"Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Very well. “As he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests.” I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest…",iron_man_2
stern,That’s enough Colonel,iron_man_2
Rhodey,…to fold Mr Stark…,iron_man_2
stern,That’s enough,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"…into the existing chain of command, Senator.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I’m not a joiner, but I’ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,We can amend the hours a little bit.,iron_man_2
stern,"I’d like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that’s connected to your report.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.,iron_man_2
stern,"With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we’d be very grateful. Let’s have the images.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark’s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground…",iron_man_2
Rhodey,"… indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here. [Sets up his device to connect with the screen showing the pictures.] Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on.",iron_man_2
stern,What is he doing?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea. [Video of a suit. It falls over and clearly doesn’t work very well at all.]",iron_man_2
stern,Can you turn that off? Take it off. [Justin Hammer stands up],iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Iran.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Justin, you’re on TV. Focus up.",iron_man_2
tv justin,"Okay, give me a left twist. Left’s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"[Just as not-TV Justin finds the plug and unplugs the screen] Wow. Yeah, I’d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty.",iron_man_2
justin,I’d like to point out that that test pilot survived.,iron_man_2
stern,I think we’re done is the point that he’s making. I don’t think there’s any reason…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"The point is, you’re welcome, I guess",iron_man_2
stern,For what?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Because I’m your nuclear deterrent. It’s working. We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it. But I did you a big favour.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I’ve successfully privatised world peace.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.,iron_man_2
stern,"[beep] you, Mr Stark. [beep] you, buddy. We’re adjourned. We’re adjourned for today.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"[puts on sunglasses. Rhodey’s still sitting down and has the same look on his face as Pepper did. Basically, they’re both tired of Tony not taking serious things seriously] Okay.",iron_man_2
stern,You’ve been a delight.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,My bond is with the people. And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself. If there’s one thing I’ve proven it’s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Wake up, Daddy’s home.",iron_man_2
"jarvis (v.o., a.i)","Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You!,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I swear to God I’ll dismantle you. I’ll soak your motherboard. I’ll turn you into a wine rack.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?,iron_man_2
jarvis,"We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Check palladium levels.,iron_man_2
jarvis,"Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"[Takes Arc Reactor out of chest. The core pops out, rusted and slightly smoking.] God, they’re running out quick.",iron_man_2
jarvis,"I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.",iron_man_2
jarvis,"You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that’s keeping you alive is also killing you.",iron_man_2
jarvis,Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Mute.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Is this a joke? What are you thinking?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,What?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,What are you thinking?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Did you just donate…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Keep your business.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,…our entire modern art collection to the…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Boy Scouts of America.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,…Boy Scouts of America?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn’t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it’s not “our” collection, it’s my collection. No offence.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"No, you know what? I think I’m actually entitled to say “our” collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,It was a tax write-off. I needed that.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"You know, there’s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"[to another robot] Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,That’s rude.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,The Expo is your ego gone crazy.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[Picking up a painting. Of Iron Man] Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,You’ve got to be kidding.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,No. Our stocks have never been higher.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Yes, from a managerial standpoint.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Let me give you an example.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Let’s move onto another subject.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Let’s see what I can get going on here.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll…",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Everything was my idea.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,…and you won’t make a decision.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert. [Jumps off desk] You do it.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,I do what?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Yeah, I’m trying to run the company.",iron_man_2

Pepper Potts,…in order to…,iron_man_2

Pepper Potts,I am trying to do it.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Pepper, you’re not listening to me!",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"No, you are not listening to me.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Have you been drinking?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not. [One of the robots brings him a tray which a bottle and glasses on it] Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it’s you. It’s always been you. [Pours champagne. Pepper sits down, shocked and confused]. I thought there’d be a legal issue, but actually I’m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you. [Hands her a glass. She doesn’t take it.] Congratulations? Take it, just take it.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,I don’t know what to think.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Don’t think, drink. There you go. [They tap glasses and drink]",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,The notary’s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I’m on happy time. [Tony hits Happy in the face with his elbow] Sorry.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,What the hell was that?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,"It’s called dirty boxing, there’s nothing new about it",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"All right, put them up. Come on. [A woman walks in. Both Happy and Tony’s attention shifts to her]",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,I promise this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.,iron_man_2
notary,I need you to initial each box.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,"[Taps Tony on the back of the head with a light punch, not enough to hurt him] Lesson one. Never take your eye off… [Tony kicks him and he goes crashing into the corner of the ring. Camera angle shifts to Pepper and the Notary and clangs are heard.]",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,That’s it. I’m done. What’s your name lady?,iron_man_2
notary,Rushman. Natalie Rushman [So we shall now refer to Notary as Natalie],iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Front and centre. Come into the church.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,No. You’re seriously not gonna ask…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"If it pleases the court, which it does.",iron_man_2
natalie,[To Pepper] It’s no problem.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,[To Natalie] I’m sorry. He’s very eccentric.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Can you give her a lesson?,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,No problem.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[Steps out of ring and towards Pepper] Pepper.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,What?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[Sitting down next to Pepper] Who is she?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I need a new assistant, boss.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Yes, and I’ve got three excellent potential candidates. They’re lined up and ready to meet you.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I don’t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it’s her.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,No it’s not.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,You ever boxed before?,iron_man_2
natalie,"I have, yes.",iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,"What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that? [Natalie’s face shows brief annoyance at his statement before Tony distracts her]",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"How do I spell your name, Natalie?",iron_man_2
natalie,R-U-S-H-M-A-N.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"What, are you gonna google her now?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I thought I was ogling her. [Brings up Natalie’s file on table which doubles up as a computer. He has computers on everything.] Wow. Very, very impressive individual.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"You’re so predictable, you know that?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,No one speaks Latin.,iron_man_2

Pepper Potts,When did this happen?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,What? You made me do it.,iron_man_2

Tony Stark,"You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don’t flare your nostrils.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,You are so predictable.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,That’s the amazing thing.,iron_man_2
natalie,Right this way.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You look fantastic.,iron_man_2
natalie,"Why, thank you very much.",iron_man_2

Pepper Potts,Mr Musk. How are you?,iron_man_2
mr musk,"Hi, Pepper. Congratulations on the promotion.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Thank you very much.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Elon, how’s it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic.",iron_man_2
mr musk,"Thank you. Yeah, I’ve got an idea for an electric jet.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You do?,iron_man_2
mr musk,Yeah.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Then we’ll make it work. [To Pepper as they walk] You want a massage?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Oh, God. No. I don’t want a massage.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I’ll have Natalie make an…,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,I don’t want Natalie to do…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Don’t want you tense. By the way, I didn’t mean to spring this on you.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Thank you very much.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Green is not your best colour. [Justin’s head appears from behind someone],iron_man_2

Pepper Potts,Sure.,iron_man_2
justin,"She’s actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair. I thought I’d throw her a bone, you know. Right?",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,And she wrote a story as well.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,It was very impressive.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,That was good.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,It was very well done.,iron_man_2

christine,"Listen, is it the first time you’ve seen each other since the Senate?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Since he got his contract revoked…,iron_man_2
justin,"Actually, it’s on hold.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,…when you were attempting to…That’s not what I heard. What’s the difference between “hold and “cancelled”? The truth?,iron_man_2
christine,"Yes, what is it?",iron_man_2
justin,"No. The truth is… Why don’t we put that away? The truth is, I’m actually hoping to present something at your Expo.",iron_man_2

Tony Stark,[In the mirror] Got any other bad ideas?,iron_man_2
justin,"[Still inside, talking to Christine.] Tony and I… Tony… I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We’re not competitors. Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know? Everything that Tony and I do…",iron_man_2

Tony Stark,"Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It’s effective. Not very efficient. But it’s a passable knock-off. I don’t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places.",iron_man_2

ivan,"Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die. [Tony leaves the cell]",iron_man_2
stern,"It’s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he’s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy.

Tony Stark,Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That’s the truth.,iron_man_2

Tony Stark,This is your in-flight meal.,iron_man_2

Tony Stark,Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?,iron_man_2

Apparently you do too, for Tony Stark. What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was… Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I’d be listening. This is why I couldn’t bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don’t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That’s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor.

Tony Stark,You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"We don’t have to do this, Tony.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,Put it down!,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You gonna take a shot?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Put it down!,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,No!,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Drop it Tony!,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Take it! [Their blasts meet and there goes Tony’s house. Both of them are knocked backwards. Tony looks around and sees Rhodey take off in the suit.],iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet… [Rhodey lands in suit.]",iron_man_2
major allen,Colonel.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Major.,iron_man_2
major allen,Wow.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Yeah. Let’s take it inside.,iron_man_2
major allen,Clear the area.,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,Sir! I’m gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[Now inside sitting at a table with Fury] I told you I don’t wanna join your super-secret boy band.,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How’s that working out for you?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,It’s… It’s… It’s… I’m sorry. I don’t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I’m a bit hung over. I’m not sure if you’re real of if I’m having…,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,I am very real. I’m the realest person you’re ever gonna meet.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Just my luck. Where’s the staff here?,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,That’s not looking so good.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I’ve been worse. [A woman walks over. Camera angle is such that you can’t see her face.],iron_man_2
shield agent,We’ve secured the perimeter but I don’t think we should hold it for too much longer.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[Looks over top of glasses. Sees Natalie.] You’re fired.,iron_man_2
natalie,That’s not up to you. [Sits down next to Fury],iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Hi.,iron_man_2
natalie/agent romanoff,"I’m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I suggest you apologise.,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"You’ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you’re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn’t know better…",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You don’t know better. I didn’t give it to him. He took it.,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it? You’re Iron Man and he just took it? The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit? [Turns to Agent Romanoff] Is that possible?",iron_man_2
agent romanoff,"Well, according to Mr Stark’s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,What do you want from me?,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"What do we want from you? What do you want from me? [Agent Romanoff leaves] You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with. [Romanoff returns with an injection] Hit him.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it? [Rash goes down] Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,What did we just do for you? That’s lithium dioxide. It’s gonna take the edge off. We’re trying to get you back to work.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Give me a couple of boxes of that. I’ll be right as rain.,iron_man_2
agent romanoff,"It’s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,Doesn’t look like it’s gonna be an easy fix.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Trust me, I know. I’m good at this stuff. I’ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I’ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"Well, I’m here to tell you, you haven’t tried them all.",iron_man_2
justin,"Hey, hey, het. Special delivery. Candygram. [Ivan climbs down from where he was working] I brought you something. Oh yeah. [Removes cloth] We got you the bird, pal.",iron_man_2
ivan,This is not my bird.,iron_man_2
justin,"What do you mean? That’s the bird. This is the bird. Yeah, pulled a lot of strings to get this bird. This is a great bird.",iron_man_2
jack,It’s a beautiful bird.,iron_man_2
justin,We got this bird all the way from Russia.,iron_man_2
ivan,"Hey, man, this is not my bird.",iron_man_2
justin,"Well, listen, even if it’s not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird. I mean, you know, look, don’t get so attached to things. Learn to let go. Wait a minute. Jack, what is that? Is that… That’s not a helmet. What is that? [Walks up to suit] Ivan… What’s this? Jack. Is that a helmet? It doesn’t look like a helmet to me. How… How are you supposed to get a head in there? Jack, could you put your head in there?",iron_man_2
jack,No.,iron_man_2
justin,"Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there. [Jack put it on his head] See, Ivan? He can’t put his head in there. That’s… That’s not a helmet. It’s a head. I need to put a guy in there. I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?",iron_man_2
ivan,Drone better.,iron_man_2
justin,What? Drone better? Why is drone better? Why is drone better?,iron_man_2
ivan,People make problem. Trust me. Drone better.,iron_man_2
justin,"Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, “No problem.” That’s what you said to me. You said, “No problem.” Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That’s what the people want. That’s what’s gonna make them happy.",iron_man_2
ivan,"Hey, man. Don’t get too attached to things. Learn to let go.",iron_man_2
justin,"These drones better steal the show, Ivan. You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.",iron_man_2
general,Unbelievable. This ought to get the Senate off my ass. It’s functional?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Fully mission-capable.,iron_man_2
general,Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponise it.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Sir?,iron_man_2
general,Justin Hammer’s making a weapons presentation at the Expo. We’d like this to introduce it.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Sir, I don’t believe that the Expo…",iron_man_2
general,"Colonel, the world needs to see this fast. We’ve got to make this happen.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Yes, General, but…",iron_man_2
general,It’s also an order.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Yes sir.,iron_man_2
general,"Good work, Colonel. You’ve made your country proud.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,Thank you sir.,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn’t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,He said that?,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan.",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,What do you remember about your dad?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,That’s not true.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,What?,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,I got a two o’clock,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"Okay, you’re good, right?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"No, I’m not good.",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,You got this? Right? Right?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Yeah.,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you. [Fury leaves]",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"[Turning to Agent Coulson] Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice.",iron_man_2
agent coulson,"I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I think I got it, yeah.",iron_man_2
agent coulson,Enjoy your evening’s entertainment. [Leaves. Tony looks at the box that has been left for him.],iron_man_2
major allen,Think this is the power source?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let’s just focus on arming it, all right?",iron_man_2
major allen,"Yes, sir.",iron_man_2
justin,"[Entering. Sucking on a red lollipop.] Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?",iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you’re gonna do for us.",iron_man_2
justin,"What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I’m gonna do for you is I’m gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should…",iron_man_2
Rhodey,That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about firepower.,iron_man_2
justin,"Well, you’re talking to the right guy. [Bites lollipop. Time jump. Kind of. He now has weapons to show to Rhodey.] Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You’re not a hunter. What am I talking about? I’m getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It’s beautiful, But I can tell this isn’t disco enough for you, so I’m gonna put it right here. You’re looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You’re tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don’t let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine DX burst. It’s capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff’s Third. My Pieta. It’s completely elegant. It’s bafflingly beautiful. And it’s capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That’s the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You’re like a sphinx. I can’t read you.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,I think I’ll take it.,iron_man_2
justin,Which one?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,All of it.,iron_man_2
justin,All of it.,iron_man_2
Howard Stark,"Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust heath, [Tony is flicking through a notebook as the video plays] and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. I’m Howard Stark, and everything you’ll need for the future can be found right here. City of the Future? City of Tomorrow? City of… I’m Howard Stark and everything you’ll need in the future can be found right here. So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I would like to personally… Tony, what are you doing back there? What is that? [Little Tony has picked one of the buildings up off the model.] Put that back. Put it back where you got it from. Where’s your mother? Maria? Go on. Go, go, go, go. [A man takes little Tony off, presumably to where his mother is]",iron_man_2
man (out of sight),"All right, I think we got…",iron_man_2
Howard Stark,I’ll… I’ll… I’ll come in and… [Video changes],iron_man_2
man,Are you waiting on me? [Howard drinks. Looks like whiskey. Video changes again],iron_man_2
Howard Stark,"So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I’d like to personally show you my ass. I’d like to… I can’t… This is… I can’t… We have this, don’t we? This is a ridiculous way… Everything [Tony reaches end of notebook. Blank pages. Probably ones his father never got to fill in as he died] is achievable through technology. [Tony throws the book to one side and drinks] Tony. You’re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you’ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future. I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you’ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you. [Tony looks like he’s about to cry as the film ends.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,How much?,iron_man_2
strawberry man,$6. Six.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I don’t have any dough. Here. [Takes off watch],iron_man_2
strawberry man,"No, sir, that’s too much.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"No, it’s fine. Take that. It’s fine",iron_man_2
strawberry man,"No, señor.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Take it. Take it. I don’t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that’d be great.",iron_man_2
strawberry man,Are you Iron Man?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Sometimes.,iron_man_2
strawberry man,[As Tony drives off] We believe in you!,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.,iron_man_2
pa,Miss Potts?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Relax.,iron_man_2
pa,Mr Stark…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Is here.,iron_man_2
pa,He refuses…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I don’t. It’s fine. I’ll just be a second.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Listen, it’s our position that Stark has and continues to maintain propriety ownership of the Mark II platform.",iron_man_2
news reporter (on telly),"When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man, he was making a promise to America.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"No, the suit belongs to us.",iron_man_2
news reporter,We trusted that he would look out for us.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Yeah, but you’re not…",iron_man_2
news reporter,He obviously did not.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Burt…,iron_man_2
news reporter,And now we learn that his secretary…,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Yes, it does.",iron_man_2
news reporter,"…a woman named Virginia “Pepper” Potts, has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries. What are her qualifications?",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,No.,iron_man_2
news reporter,Miss Potts has done nothing to manage this terrible…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Mute.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"No… Burt… Burt… Burt, listen to me. Don’t tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[Looking at boxes and things in the corner.] I’ll get this stuff out of here.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We’ll talk about it at the Expo. [Tony pulls back a sheet and finds the same model as that that was in the video with his father] Hammer’s giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony Stark be there?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[Pulling up a chair] Will I?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"No, he will not. Bye.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I would like to be. Got a minute?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,No.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Come on, you just got off the phone. You’re fine. 30 seconds.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I’m not.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,You didn’t come here to apologise?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,No.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say “I” one more time, I’m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Yes.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you’ve disappeared, and all I’m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there’s only one thing on Earth that I’m allergic to?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,I need you…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I need you too.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,…to leave now,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,That’s what I’m trying to…,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,[Entering as Natalie in front of Happy] Ms Potts?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Hi, come on in.",iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,Wheels up in 25 minutes.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Thank you.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,"Anything else, boss?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I’m good, Hap.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"No, I’ll be just another minute.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I lost both the kids in the divorce. [Tony looks over to Happy, who shakes his head.] Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,No. That’s not so.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Actually, while you’re here maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.",iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,Absolutely. [Pepper and Happy leave] I’m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Boy, you’re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things… You’re a triple imposter. I’ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?",iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,[Latin],iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected. [She leaves.],iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You’re good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection.",iron_man_2
jarvis,"1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[Lifting the blue projection away from the model] How many buildings are there?,iron_man_2
jarvis,Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,That was rhetorical. Just show me. [Clicks his fingers and the model begins to spin and lifts upright] What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.,iron_man_2
jarvis,"What is it you’re trying to achieve, sir?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees. [Tony flicks things away] Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad. [The model now resembles a nucleus and Tony expands it.] Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school. [Tony snaps down so the model fits in his hand]",iron_man_2
jarvis,The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Thank Dad.,iron_man_2
jarvis,"Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode.",iron_man_2
agent coulson,I heard you broke the perimeter.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?",iron_man_2
agent coulson,I was doing some stuff.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?",iron_man_2
agent coulson,[Pulls a familiar looking object out of a box] What’s this doing here?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,That’s it. Bring that to me.,iron_man_2
agent coulson,You know what this is?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"[As Agent Coulson hands it to him] It’s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And… Drop it. Drop it. [The shield is now in position and the coil straight.] Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?",iron_man_2
agent coulson,Nothing. Goodbye. I’ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.,iron_man_2
agent coulson,So I’m told.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Secret stuff?,iron_man_2
agent coulson,Something like that. Good luck.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Bye. Thanks. [They shake hands],iron_man_2
agent coulson,We need you.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Yeah, more than you know.",iron_man_2
agent coulson,Not that much. [He leaves. Tony goes back to building.],iron_man_2
jarvis,"Initialising prismatic accelerator. [Tony turns a wheel on top] Approaching maximum power. [Using a wrench as a lever, the wheel is turned, but not before cutting holes in the wall. Eventually it’s concentrated on a triangle which begins to glow blue.]",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,That was easy. [He removes the triangle using a pair of pliers],iron_man_2
jarvis,"Congratulations sir. You have created a new element. [Placed into arc reactor] Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics.",iron_man_2
ivan,The drone is not going to be ready.,iron_man_2
justin,Not ready? What do you mean?,iron_man_2
ivan,"I can make presentation, not demonstration.",iron_man_2
justin,What the hell is the difference?,iron_man_2
ivan,Presentation. No fly. No shoot.,iron_man_2
justin,"Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.",iron_man_2
ivan,I can make salute.,iron_man_2
justin,"You can make salute? What do you mean “make salute”? What the hell does that mean Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay? You promised me suits and then you promised me drones. [Camera pans to show Ivan has remade his arc reactor whips]",iron_man_2
ivan,"Hey, man, everything will be okay.",iron_man_2
justin,This is not what I wanted.,iron_man_2
justin,"Hey, there he is. It’s the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I’m confused. You said it wasn’t, but now it looks like you’re the best of pals. You love that bird, don’t you? You know what? Take the bird.",iron_man_2
ivan,[As man grabs bird] Hey!,iron_man_2
justin,"Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. ‘Cause that’s how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don’t know if you’re a genius or a fraud. I don’t know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn’t, I’d be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I’m getting at here?",iron_man_2
ivan,[Russian],iron_man_2
justin,"I don’t know if you know this, but I don’t speak Russian! I’m gonna leave now. I’m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I’ll even get laid. You see these guys? They’re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we’re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you’re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don’t, you’re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV. [Leaves]",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You’re killing me. You know I don’t…",iron_man_2
jarvis,Incoming call with a blocked number sir.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How’s the Land of Enchantment?,iron_man_2
ivan,"Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You what?,iron_man_2
ivan,You told me double cycle’s more power. Good advice.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.,iron_man_2

ivan,"Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Jarvis, where is he?",iron_man_2
jarvis,Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.,iron_man_2
ivan,"What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Sounds good. Let’s get together and hash it out.,iron_man_2
jarvis,Tri-State area. Manhattan and outlying boroughs.,iron_man_2
ivan,I hope you’re ready. [Call ends],iron_man_2
jarvis,Call trace incomplete.,iron_man_2
jarvis,Sir,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you’re at it. Put it together now.",iron_man_2
jarvis,We are unclear as to the effects.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I don’t want to hear it Jarvis. [Reactor gains power] That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!",iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,"I’ll keep the car down here, all right?",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Thank you Happy.,iron_man_2
announcer,…Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.,iron_man_2
justin,"Yeah. That’s what I’m talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm’s way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That’s not fair. That’s not right. And it’s just too bad.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Oh, Lord.",iron_man_2
justin,"Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink. [Two people run on to remove the podium] Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military. The Hammer drone. [Drones rise out of the stage as he calls names] Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That’s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war [Ivan is typing something] Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,What? [Rises and salutes.],iron_man_2
justin,"For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for… [incoming Iron Man]",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,We got trouble.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Tony, there are civilians present. I’m here on orders. Let’s not do this right now.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Give them a wave.,iron_man_2
justin,"Hey, all right. Yeah.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,Vanko’s alive?,iron_man_2
justin,Yeah. [Tony approaches him],iron_man_2
Tony Stark,What is he?,iron_man_2
justin,What?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Where’s Vanko?,iron_man_2
justin,Who?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Tell me.,iron_man_2
justin,What are you doing here man?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[As a large gun takes aim] Is that you?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"No, I’m not doing that. That’s not me. I can’t move. I’m locked up. I’m locked up! [Drones take aim] Get out of here. Go! This whole system’s been compromised.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[Takes off] Let’s take it outside. [Drones and Rhodey fire at him. Rhodey takes off],iron_man_2
Rhodey,"No, no!",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.",iron_man_2
jarvis,Yes sir.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Tony, Tony, I’m locked on. I have target lock.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,On what?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"On you. [Shooting at Tony] Tony, on your six!",iron_man_2
justin,[Running to a computer] What’s going on? What’s happening?,iron_man_2
technician,The software’s been overridden.,iron_man_2
justin,What? What do you mean it’s been overridden? What does that mean?,iron_man_2
technician,I think he slaved the drones.,iron_man_2
justin,That’s impossible. Call the guards.,iron_man_2
jack,All the phones are down sir.,iron_man_2
justin,"Well, then call their… Call their cells.",iron_man_2
jack,Their cell phones are not working either sir.,iron_man_2
technician,He’s locked us out of the mainframe.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,[Entering] Who’s locked you out of the mainframe?,iron_man_2
justin,"Please, please, go away. Go away. I’ve got this handled.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Have you now?,iron_man_2
justin,"Yes, I do. In fact, if your guy hadn’t showed up, this wouldn’t be happening. So, please, now go away. Thank you [To technician] Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here. What?",iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,[Grabs Justin and holds him down on the desk] You tell me who’s behind this. Who’s behind this?,iron_man_2
justin,Ivan. Ivan Vanko.,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,Where is he?,iron_man_2
justin,At my facility.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"I need NYPD, please.",iron_man_2
justin,"No, no, no!",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Command Central.,iron_man_2
justin,"No, no, honey. Don’t call the authorities.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Okay. Right away. Right away. [To Justin] Step aside. Step aside. [To technician] Tell me everything you know. Go.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,How are we doing Jarvis?,iron_man_2
jarvis,Remote reboot unsuccessful.,iron_man_2
security guard,This way.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,Nobody’s answering the phone. What’s going on?,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,I’m not taking you anywhere.,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,Fine. You want me to drive?,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,"No, I’m driving. Get in the car.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Nice work kid. [Takes off again],iron_man_2
Rhodey,You got multiples coming in on you.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Let’s get this away from the Expo.,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,"Wen we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter. [She’s getting undressed in the back of the car] I’m gonna enter the facility and take down the target. Watch the road.",iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,I got it. I got it.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They’re headed back to the Expo.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Got it.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,In closing in on you. Ordnance coming in hot Tony. Watch it.,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,Stay in the car.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,I’m not staying in the car.,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,"I said, stay in the car.",iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,"[As Natasha heads up the stairs to the front door] What are you wearing? Look, I’m not letting you go in there alone.",iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,You want to help? Keep the car running.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,[Opens the door as she unlocks it and runs in] Okay.,iron_man_2
hammer security guard,"Hey, hey, hey. You can’t come in here.",iron_man_2
second guard,Hold on. Hey!,iron_man_2
technician,Each set of drone is communicating in its own unique language.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Well, choose one and focus on that.",iron_man_2
justin,Have you tried Russian? Why don’t you try Russian?,iron_man_2
announcement,Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.,iron_man_2
security guard,We got it. We’re on our way.,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,I got him! [Sees what Natasha has done,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Rhodey, you still locked on?",iron_man_2
Rhodey,Yeah.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We’re about to get wet on this ride.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Wait, wait, wait!",iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,He’s gone.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I’m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What’s your 20?,iron_man_2
Happy Hogan,What are you doing?,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,I’m rebooting Rhodey’s suit.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Tony.,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,Reboot complete [Image of Tony on screen] You got your best friend back.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.",iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Yes, for the moment, I’m not dying. Thank you.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,[Image appears on second screen] What do you mean you’re not dying? Did you just say you’re dying?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Is that you? No, I’m not. Not anymore. [Natasha looks confused.]",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,What’s going on?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You didn’t let me.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Why didn’t you tell me that?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,"Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight’s coming to you.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Great. Pepper?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Are you okay now?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I am fine. Don’t be mad. I will formally apologise…,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,I am mad!,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,…when I’m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Fine.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,We could have been in Venice.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Oh please.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They’re coming. Come on, let’s roll. Get up.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,"[Helmet opens] Oh, man. You can have your suit back.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,[Helps him up] You okay?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I’m sorry, okay?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Don’t be.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,No. I should have trusted you more.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I’m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,No. It’s your fault. I just wanted to say I’m sorry.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Thank you. That’s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They’re coming in hot, any second. What’s the play?",iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let’s put the biggest gun up on that ridge.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Got you. Where do you want to be?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Where are you going?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,What’re you talking about?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,I meant me.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Tony, don’t be jealous.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,No. It’s subtle all the bells and whistles.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Yeah. It’s called being a badass.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Fine. All right. You go up to. I’ll draw them in.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,Don’t stay down here. This is the worst place to be.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Okay, you got a spot. Where’s mine?",iron_man_2
Rhodey,"It’s the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die. [Drones incoming. And Rhodey and Ton are still in the kill box. Helmets down. Shooting begins.]",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,See that?,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Yeah, yeah. Nice.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Rhodey? Get down. [Laser slices all the drones in half. And a tree.],iron_man_2
Rhodey,Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It’s a one-off.,iron_man_2
justin,I told you that five minutes ago.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,[As police enter] That’s your guy here.,iron_man_2
justin,Excuse me?,iron_man_2
police officer,You’re being placed under arrest.,iron_man_2
justin,Are you kidding me?,iron_man_2
police officer,Hands behind your back sir.,iron_man_2
justin,"I’m trying to help here. I get it. I see what you’re doing. You’re trying to pin this on me, huh? That’s good. That’s good. You’re starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition. I like that. You think you’re making a problem for me? [Being led away] I’m gonna make a problem for you. I’m gonna be seeing you again real soon.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"[Now outside with some police officers] When they get here, I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits.",iron_man_2
police officer,We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines.",iron_man_2
police officer,Yeah. Are you coming with us?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"No, I’m gonna stay until to park is clear.",iron_man_2
police officer,Okay.,iron_man_2
Natasha Romanov,Head up. You got one more drone incoming. This one looks different. [Tony and Rhodey; Natasha on speaker] The repulsor signature is significantly higher.,iron_man_2
ivan,[Landing in a full suit] Good to be back.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,This ain’t gonna be good. [Ivan’s whisps turn on] I got something special for this guy. I’m gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"With the what? [Rhodey shoots it and it bounces off Ivan, fizzling off in the water] Hammer tech?",iron_man_2
Rhodey,Yeah.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"I got this. [Targets points on Ivan’s armour. Doesn’t do much. Both shooting, fighting. Ends with both Tony and Rhodey held onto by Ivan’s whips] Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?",iron_man_2
Rhodey,What?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,This is your idea?,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Yep.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,"I’m ready. I’m ready. Go, go, go!",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Take it! [Same as at the house, they shoot each other and the middle explodes. Unfortunately for Ivan, he is in the middle]",iron_man_2
ivan,You lose. [Dies. Reactor starts flashing red. So do all the drones],iron_man_2
Rhodey,All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Pepper? [Takes off. Pepper is by a drone. Tony grabs her just as it explodes. They land on a roof. Takes off helmet.],iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Oh my God. I can’t take this anymore.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You can’t?,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,I can’t take this.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Look at me.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you’re gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I think I did okay. [Everything being on fire having been covered by exploding drones behind him. One more explosion. Just as he finishes speaking.],iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,I quit. I’m resigning. That’s it.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"What did you just say? You’re done? That’s surprising. No, it’s not surprising. I get it. You don’t have to make excuses.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,I’m… I’m… I’m not making any excuses.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You actually were just making excuses. But you don’t have to.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"No, I wasn’t making an excuse. I’m actually very justified.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Well…,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"You’ve taken such good care of me. I’ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so… Right?",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Thank you.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Yeah.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Thank you for understanding.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk clean-up.",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,I’ll handle the transition. It’ll be smooth.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"Well, with you it’s like dog years.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I know.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"I mean, it’s like the Presidency. [They kiss]",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Weird.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"No, it’s not weird.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"It’s okay, right?",iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,Yeah.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Run that by me again. [They start to kiss again],iron_man_2
Rhodey,I think it was weird. [They break apart and turn around] You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.,iron_man_2
Pepper Potts,"I had just quit, actually.",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"Yeah, so we’re not…",iron_man_2
Rhodey,You don’t have to do that. I heard the whole thing.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,You should get lost.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,I was here first. Get a roof.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,I thought you were out of one-liners.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,That’s the last one.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"You kicked ass back there, by the way.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,"Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I’m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,Not okay. Not okay with that.,iron_man_2
Rhodey,It wasn’t a question. [Takes off],iron_man_2
Tony Stark,How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?,iron_man_2
Nick Fury,"I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it. [Hands Tony the file]",iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"“Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it.",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,Read on.,iron_man_2
Tony Stark,“Tony Stark not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship. [Fury walks round and rest against the table by Tony’s chair],iron_man_2
Nick Fury,Which leads us to believe at this juncture we’d only like to use you as a consultant. [Tony stands and offers his hand. They shake],iron_man_2
Tony Stark,"[Clasping his other hand on top of Fury’s] You can’t afford me. [Goes to leave, but turns around again] Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.",iron_man_2
Nick Fury,I’ll see what I can do.,iron_man_2
stern,"It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure. [Pinning on medals] Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.",iron_man_2
Rhodey,Thank you sir.,iron_man_2
stern,"Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this. [Tony winces in pain] Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn’t it? Let’s get a photo.",iron_man_2
agent coulson,"Sir, we’ve found it.",iron_man_2
asgardian pa,"This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman. We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault - The engines are dead, life support failing. Requesting aid from any vessel within range. We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.

I repeat, this is not a warcraft!",avengers_infinity_war

Loki,"Oh, I do. Kill away!",avengers_infinity_war
Loki,"[starts losing his cool demeanor almost immediately as Thor suffers, and breaks after only a few moments] ALL RIGHT, STOP!",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,You really are the worst brother.,avengers_infinity_war
Loki,"[While holding the Tesseract out to Thanos and advancing] I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again.",avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.",avengers_infinity_war
Loki,"Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... We have a Hulk.",avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,Let him have his fun.,avengers_infinity_war
Heimdall,[prays] Allfathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,That was a mistake.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,NO!!! [after Thanos kills Heimdall] You're going to die for that!,avengers_infinity_war

Pepper Potts,[laughing slightly and talking over him] You're totally rambling.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[also talking over her] No, I'm not.",avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,Lost me.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?",avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,Yeah.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Okay, and then you're like, ""Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?"" ""Oh! Someone's watching."" ""I'm gonna go in my pants.""",avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,"Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Yes.,avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,Yeah. Everybody has that.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?",avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,[Nodding in understanding] Right.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Morgan! Morgan.,avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,"So you woke up, and thought that we were...",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Expecting.,avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,Yeah.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,[Becoming excited] Yes?,avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,[Shaking her head] No.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,I had a dream about it. It was so real.,avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,"If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.",avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,"It's not helping your case, OK?",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-",avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,[insistently] You don't need that.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future usses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...",avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,Shirts?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.,avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,You should have shirts in your closet.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.,avengers_infinity_war

doctor e,"Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"And who's ""we""?",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"[emerges from behind Doctor e] Hey, Tony.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,[looking surprised] Bruce.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,Pepper.,avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,Hi.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,You okay?,avengers_infinity_war
Wong,"[Using magic to show the universe and five out of six Infinity Stones] From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,[Each Stone lights up as Strange names them.] Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,[very attentive] Tell me his name again.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's him.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,[Speaking to himself] This is it... What's our timeline?,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[Leans against a cauldron, stretching like he's about to go for a run] Did you seriously just say ""hitherto undreamt of""?",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Is that what this is...?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[looking offended] [straightening himself] I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,No can do.,avengers_infinity_war
Wong,We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,Stark Raving Hazelnuts.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,It's not bad.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,A bit chalky.,avengers_infinity_war
Wong,"""A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge"" is our favorite.",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,That's a thing?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,things change.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"Well, if we don't do our jobs.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[Slightly condescending] What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"[Completely calm] Protecting your reality, douchebag.",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[awkwardly] Yeah, that's the... thing.",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,What do you mean?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"What? Tony, you lost another super bot?",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"Who could find Vision, then?",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,[quietly to himself] Shit. [to the other men in a normal tone] Probably Steve Rogers.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"[sighing in exasperation] Oh, great.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Maybe. But... [sighs],avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,[missing the events of the Avengers' Civil War] Call him.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,No.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,The Avengers broke up. We're toast.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,[Rather surprised and slightly let-down] Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"[Almost pleading] Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"[Looking up at his forelock fluttering] Not at the moment, no.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,You okay?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Help him! Wong, Doc.",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,Go! Got it!,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[Putting on his sunglasses] F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?",avengers_infinity_war
f.r.i.d.a.y.,"Not sure, I'm working on it.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,[Bands of spells are readied around his forearms] Might wanna use it.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"[Tapping his best friend in the seat in front of him] Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.",avengers_infinity_war
ned leeds,[Turns around and sees the spaceship] Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.",avengers_infinity_war
f.r.i.d.a.y.,Will do.,avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,"Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[Echoing the familiarly defiant 2008 Tony Stark] I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.",avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,[Looks at e] Stonekeeper... [Gestures to Tony] Does this chattering animal speak for you?,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"Certainly not. I speak for myself. [Magical shields are readied with his fists, stepping forward.] But you’re trespassing in this city and on this planet. [Wong emulates him.]",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"It means get lost, Squidward!",avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,He exhausts me.,avengers_infinity_war
cull obsidian,[Two untranslated syllables],avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,Bring me the Stone.,avengers_infinity_war
cull obsidian,[Three untranslated syllables] [He drops his huge alien hammer and drags it along as he obeys his brethren.],avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Banner, you want a piece?",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,That's right.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Where's your guy?,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,There's no time for a thing.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,I know.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,[points at the approaching Obsidian] That's the thing right there. Let's go.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[glances at e] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"Tony, I'm sorry. [stammers] Either I can't or he won't-",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"It's okay. Hey, stand down. [to Wong] Keep an eye on him. Thank you.",avengers_infinity_war
Wong,I have him.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,Damn it.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,Where'd that come from?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us...",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Gotta get that stone outta here, now.",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,It stays with me.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Exactly. Bye.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"[Rushing over to Tony] Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,I'm trying. He won't come out.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Hammer. [Pushes Bruce out of the way],avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"[Crawling out from under the branches. Desperate and confused] Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me? [starts slapping himself multiple times] Come out! Come out! Come out!",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,[Half of Bruce's face becomes the Hulk.] Nooooooo! [Bruce falls back exhausted into his tree],avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"What do you mean, ""no""?!",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Kid, where'd you come from?",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,Field trip to MoMA.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.,avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.,avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,[Vehemently.] Then I'll take it off your corpse.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.,avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,"You'll only wish you were dead. [e falls unconscious and to the ground; Maw raises a portion of street pavement to use as a carrier, but the Cloak of Levitation works its master loose of the cable spiral and flies Strange away] NO!",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[Still fighting Cull Obsidian, as e passes through the park] Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,On it!,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,[untangles himself] Not cool!,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Uhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Hang on, kid. [Cull Obsidian's hammer doubles as a claw, pinning Tony to the ground and shorting his suit. As Obsidian jumps towards Tony, blades ready to end this fight, he is sent through a portal instead. The alien turns and leaps to return the same way, but Wong closes it rapidly -- only Obsidian's severed hand makes it back to the park. Bruce kicks the hand away with a noise of disgust.]",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[still in pursuit of the ship and his protégé.] Unlock 17-A. [A pod launches from the upstate Avengers headquarters and curves up to the accelerating circular ship] Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"But you said save the wizard! [Peter, gasping from lack of oxygen, pulls off his mask] I can't breathe!",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,You're too high up. You're running out of air.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,Yeah! That makes sense.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.",avengers_infinity_war
f.r.i.d.a.y,Yep.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"OH, COME ON!",avengers_infinity_war
f.r.i.d.a.y,"Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.",avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,"[Sounding heavily worried.] Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.",avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,Why?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,[While looking at the ship around him] Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.,avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,Tell me you're not on that ship.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Yeah.,avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,"God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.",avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,"Come back here, Tony. I swear to God…",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Pep…,avengers_infinity_war
Pepper Potts,Come back here right now! Come back!,avengers_infinity_war
f.r.i.d.a.y,"Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too…",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,Oh my God! [looks at the rapidly-receding planet behind him] I should have stayed on the bus...,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,Where you going?,avengers_infinity_war
Wong,The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,[Holding Rogers' cell phone] I'm gonna make a call.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"[chair-dancing to the song] Sing it, Drax!",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,[yawns] Why are we doing this again?,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"[annoyed] It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"I get that, but why are we doing it?",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,[waves her index finger at Quill] Which isn't the point.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,[points back at Gamora] Which isn't the point... I mean… If he doesn't pony up…,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,We'll take his ship.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,Exactly!,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,B-b-b-bingo!,avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,[reading her console] We are arriving.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces. [Groot rolls his eyes as Mantis makes a snarl. Groot's handheld Terran-vintage video game beeps.] Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again. [Game continues beeping] Groot.",avengers_infinity_war
groot,[in a mocking tone] I am Groot!,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,Whoa!,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,Language!,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Hey!,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,Wow.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"You got some acorns on you, kid.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces!",avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,What happened?,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,Looks like we're not getting paid.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,(Waving his hands) Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,How the hell is this dude still alive?,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,"[Sounding awed.] He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... This is a man. A handsome, muscular man.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,[A little dented.] I'm muscular.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Yeah, right.",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,It's true. You have gained a little weight… [Drax motions to his chin and belly],avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"What? Gamora, do you think I'm…",avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"[reaches Drax's side and picks up Thor's left arm, stroking his triceps] It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"[snidely to Gamora] Stop massaging his muscles. [Gamora, annoyed, drops the arm with a thump; quietly to Mantis] Wake him up.",avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,[Places hand on Thor's forehead.] Wake.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Who the hell are you guys?,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre...",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,Including my own.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. [she snaps her fingers]",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Your father killed my brother. [Thor stands and strides towards Gamora aggressively.],avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. [Thor softens a bit.]",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Families can be tough. [he claps a hand on Gamora's shoulder] Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister...that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes-""",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"[not paying attention as he stares at his soup spoon] I need a hammer, not a spoon… (he attempts to fiddle with machinery) How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… Maybe a birth date or something…",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,What are you doing?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Taking your pod.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"[deepens his voice] No, you're not! [mimics Thor’s accent] You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,No.,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,No I'm not.,avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,(gasp) He just did it again!,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,This is my voice!,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,[steps closer to Quill.] Are you mocking me?,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,Are you mocking me?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Stop it. You did it again.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,He's trying to copy me.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Knowhere.,avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,He must be going somewhere.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food. [To Thor as he rummages through their food stores]",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Not anymore.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Thor… Why would he go to Knowhere?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Or a genius.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,[to Thor] How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"There's six stones out there. [finishes rummaging and steps in front of Gamora] Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,The Avengers?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,[by way of explanation.] They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.,avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,Like Kevin Bacon?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"[pause] He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Then we have to go to Knowhere now.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,That's a made up word.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,All words are made up.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"Hold up, Nidavellir is real? [climbing on to the table] Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. [increasingly gleeful] They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,Rabbit?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need. [to Rocket] I assume you're the captain, sir?",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,You're very perceptive.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Wonderful.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,Except for that I'm the captain.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Quiet!,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,That's my backpack.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,Go sit down.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"[to Thor] Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to… [gropes for ""Nidavellir""] Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,The Thanos killing kind.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,A little bit. Yeah.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,He already is.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,So cool. [Smiles a big grin.],avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,[to Rocket] For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"You know, Quill, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill. [As he enters the pod] Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.",avengers_infinity_war
Vision,[gasps and holds his hand to the Mind Stone in pain],avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,Vis? Is it the stone again?,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,It's as if it's speaking to me.,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,What does it say?,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,I don't... I don't know. But something... ,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,Tell me what you feel.,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,I just feel you.,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,What if I miss that train?,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,There is an 11.,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,"What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?",avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,You gave Stark your word.,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,I'd rather give it to you.,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,"There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.",avengers_infinity_war
Vision,"Not to each other. [he puts his hands on her shoulders] Wanda… For two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know. [stammers] You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself. - I, I... I think...",avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,It works.,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,It works.,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,Then stay. Stay with me.,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,[suddenly very uncertain] Or not. If I'm overstepping…,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,[fearful] What are they?,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,What the stone was warning me about. [he kisses her hand] I have to go.,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,"No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… Then maybe going isn't the best idea.",avengers_infinity_war
Vision,"Wanda, I… [Corvus Glaive appears suddenly behind Vision, stabbing him through the back. Vision screams, loses his glamour to return to his green, red and gold appearance, and is thrown down into the street.]",avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,"Vision! [she circles her hands, gathering up energy for a counterattack when Proxima Midnight blasts her from behind, knocking Wanda across the street and through a bistro's window.]",avengers_infinity_war
Vision,The blade. It stopped me from phasing.,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,Is that even possible?,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,"It isn't supposed to be. [his voice distorts electronically] My systems are failing. [Wanda gestures over his gaping wound, using her magic to knit him back together. Vision continues in a gasping, wry tone] I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.",avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,Vis!,avengers_infinity_war
corvus glaive,"[to Vision] Give up the Stone, and she lives.",avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,Hands off.,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,"[hushed voice, pleading.] Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.",avengers_infinity_war
Vision,Please. Please leave.,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,You asked me to stay... I'm staying.,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,Please.,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,Get up.,avengers_infinity_war
proxima midnight,[to Glaive] Get up.,avengers_infinity_war
corvus glaive,I can't.,avengers_infinity_war
Natasha Romanov,[coolly] We don't wanna kill you. But we will.,avengers_infinity_war
proxima midnight,You'll never get the chance again.,avengers_infinity_war
Sam Wilson,[to Vision] Can you stand?,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,"[electricity shimmers over his surface, and his voice distorts] Thank you, Captain.",avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers,[nods] Let's get you on the jet.,avengers_infinity_war
Natasha Romanov,"[closing the doors to the Quinjet, while addressing Wanda] I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.",avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,I'm sorry. We just wanted time.,avengers_infinity_war
Sam Wilson,"Where to, Cap?",avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers,Home.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,[to Young Gamora] Shhh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.,avengers_infinity_war
child of thanos,[untranslated inquiry],avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,Zehobereians…,avengers_infinity_war
young gamora,[being dragged by one arm through the crowds] Mother! Where's my mother?!,avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,"Choose a side, or die.",avengers_infinity_war
young gamora,Mother! [She punches at the arm of the one dragging her who surprisingly drops her arm and leaves],avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,"One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.",avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"What's wrong, little one?",avengers_infinity_war
young gamora,My mother. Where is my mother?,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,[kneels down to Gamora.] What's your name?,avengers_infinity_war
young gamora,Gamora.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. [Thanos offers his hand; she wraps her little fingers around one massive finger, and he leads her to a pavilion, where he crouches to her eye level again and produces a small - for him - red-jeweled handle. Pressing the switch, razor-sharp blades pop out both ends.] Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other… [He balances it on one finger, overbalances it purposefully and catches it.] Here. You try.",avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,"Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.",avengers_infinity_war
thanos,Concentrate. There! You've got it.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the ""blow off your junk"" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to-",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,I need to ask a favor.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Yeah, sure.",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,Which is what the grenades are for. [Gamora silences him with a look.] I'm sorry. What's the favor?,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,[A beat. Confusion.] What?,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… The entire Universe could be at risk.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,What do you know?,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"If I tell you, you'd know, too.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"If it's so important, shouldn't I?",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Only if you wanna die.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"I mean, I'd like to. I really would… [Gamora silences him by covering his mouth with her hand.]",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,[a beat. One that rests with him significantly.] Okay.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,Dude. How long have you been standing there?,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,An hour.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,An hour? Are you serious?,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... That I become invisible to the eye... Watch.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,You're eating a zarg-nut.,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Mmm, no. [Quill and Gamora shake their heads.]",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,I'm sure I'm invisible.,avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,"Hi, Drax.",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,[Knowing when he is beat] Damn it.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,This place looks deserted.,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.",avengers_infinity_war
collector,I don't have it.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering. [Thanos places a heavy boot on the middle of the Collector's chest and presses.]",avengers_infinity_war
collector,[strained] I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,I imagine it's like breathing for you.,avengers_infinity_war
collector,Like suicide.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.,avengers_infinity_war
collector,I didn't know what it was.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,Today...,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,[grasping the danger] Drax. Drax.,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Drax, waaaaait! [Drax draws his long dagger from his leg scabbard] Not yet, not yet, not yet. [Drax gives him a look and heads towards Thanos. Quill hurries as quietly as possible to catch up.] Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.,avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,"Sleeeep. [Drax is knocked out, his falling body causing a loud crash. Everybody ducks.]",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm... [Gamora moves towards Thanos] The other right!",avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"Why? [he falls down] Why you? Daughter… [he holds his hand out to her, blood pooling out from his neck wound, before collapsing completely. Gamora breaks down, sobbing.]",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,[surprised] That was quick.,avengers_infinity_war
collector,Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing.",avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"That is, it was. Now… Reality can be whatever I want.",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"[her face still wet, but no longer crying] You knew I'd come.",avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,Thanos!,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"[Moving in, his blaster pointed right at Thanos] Let her go, Grimace!",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Peter…,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,[to Gamora] I told you to go right.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Now? Really?,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,You let her go!,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"Ah, the boyfriend.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Peter…,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,Or I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face!,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Not him.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,You promised! You promised.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him. [to Quill] She's asked, hasn't she? Do it. [There is a very tense and unpleasant pause. Thanos rolls his head and shoves Gamora towards Quill’s gun, egging him on.] DO IT!!",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,[tearing up] I told you to go right.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"I love you, more than anything.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"I love you, too.",avengers_infinity_war
thanos,[genuinely sincere] I like you.,avengers_infinity_war
secretary ross,Still no word from Vision?,avengers_infinity_war
james rhodes,Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.,avengers_infinity_war
secretary ross,On a stolen quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.,avengers_infinity_war
james rhodes,"You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?",avengers_infinity_war
secretary ross,"My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.",avengers_infinity_war
james rhodes,"If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.",avengers_infinity_war
secretary ross,"I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.",avengers_infinity_war
james rhodes,[sounding a little bitter] That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that. [we get a good look at his leg braces],avengers_infinity_war
secretary ross,You have second thoughts?,avengers_infinity_war
james rhodes,Not anymore.,avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers,Mr. Secretary.,avengers_infinity_war
secretary ross,You got some nerve. I'll give you that.,avengers_infinity_war
Natasha Romanov,You could use some of that right now.,avengers_infinity_war
secretary ross,"The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?",avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers,"I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight. [Cap takes a step forward, looking right at Ross] And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.",avengers_infinity_war
secretary ross,[to Rhodes] Arrest them.,avengers_infinity_war
james rhodes,"All over it. [swipes off hologram; the computer beeps twice] That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.",avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers,"[hugging War Machine] You too, Rhodey. [Black Widow gets her own embrace]",avengers_infinity_war
james rhodes,Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.,avengers_infinity_war
Sam Wilson,"Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"Uh, I think you look great. [Rhodes and Natasha long round to see Bruce walking in from the opposite end of the room] Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.",avengers_infinity_war
Natasha Romanov,"Hi, Bruce.",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,Nat.,avengers_infinity_war
Sam Wilson,[whispering] This is awkward.,avengers_infinity_war
james rhodes,"So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?",avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,And they can clearly find us.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?,avengers_infinity_war
Natasha Romanov,"After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,Who's Scott?,avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers,Ant-Man.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone.",avengers_infinity_war
Natasha Romanov,"Well then, we have to protect it.",avengers_infinity_war
Vision,"No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… Its molecular integrity could fail. [Vision addresses Wanda as he nears her]",avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,"And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.",avengers_infinity_war
Vision,Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.,avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,That's too high a price.,avengers_infinity_war
Vision,"[takes her face gently in both hands] Only you have the power to pay it. [Wanda walks away, distressed] Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.",avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers,"[Eyes diverted down.] But it should. [looks up at Vision] We don't trade lives, Vision.",avengers_infinity_war
Vision,"[walking toward Steve] Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.",avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.",avengers_infinity_war
Natasha Romanov,Can we do that?,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,Not me. Not here.,avengers_infinity_war
james rhodes,"You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.",avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers,I know somewhere.,avengers_infinity_war
okoye,"You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.",avengers_infinity_war
T'challa,And the Border Tribe?,avengers_infinity_war
okoye,Those that are left.,avengers_infinity_war
T'challa,Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.,avengers_infinity_war
okoye,And what of this one?,avengers_infinity_war
T'challa,"This one may be tired of war. [Bucky Barnes is seen at a small distance throwing a bag from a pile on the ground onto a partly-filled cart, while two village children watch] But the White Wolf has rested long enough.",avengers_infinity_war
Bucky Barnes,[with resignation] Where's the fight?,avengers_infinity_war
T'challa,On its way.,avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,"In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be...judgement. [the needles start to contact e's face, causing an obviously painful whitish subcutaneous glow at each touch] Give me... the stone.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,What the-,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,I know what you're gonna say.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,You should not be here.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,I was gonna go home -,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,I don't wanna hear it.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,And now I gotta hear it.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,(seriously) What did you just say?,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,I take that back. And now I'm here in space.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Yeah. [Iron Man crosses to stand right in front of Spidey] Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,No. I did think this through.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,You could not have possibly thought this through.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"It's just- You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man when there's no neighborhood. [he waits for Iron Man's reaction] Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[breaths shakily] Come on. We got a situation. [he leads Spider-Man over to a viewpoint on the torture below. Spidey crouches to study the situation, the Cloak leaning over his shoulder.] See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Um. Okay, okay...uh... [Spidey and the Cloak pop back upright] Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?",avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...,avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,...could end your friend's life in an instant.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.",avengers_infinity_war
ebony maw,"[walks slowly towards Iron Man, beckoning very large, very solid metal objects to float behind him] You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,Yes! Wait what are those?!,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Hey, we haven't officially met. [he offers the Cape his hand to shake. It ignores his offer and continues to e.] Cool.",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,We've gotta turn this ship around.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"No, I want to protect the stone.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[irritably] And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,For what? Nearly blasting me into space?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Who just saved your magical ass? Me.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,[raises his hand] I'm backup.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,No. You're a stowaway. [waggles a finger between himself and e] The adults are talking.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-what is he, your ward?",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"No. I'm Peter, by the way.",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,Doctor Strange.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,[walks closer to Tony] Can we control it? Fly us home? [Iron Man is lost in bad memories and does not respond right away] Stark?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Yeah?,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,Can you get us home?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[stalks over to e] No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"[pauses] Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight. [stepping over to Spider-Man, he formally taps each of Spidey's shoulders with the edge of his hand, dubbing him as is done at a knighting] Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now. [He doesn't look at him as he says those words, knowing well what he is signing him up for.]",avengers_infinity_war
thanos,I thought you might be hungry.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,I always hated that chair.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"You told me that too. [Thanos mounts two of the four steps to his throne, turns, and sits on the second from the top.] Every day. For almost twenty years.",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,I was a child when you took me.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,I saved you.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,No. No. We were happy on my home planet.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Because you murdered half the planet.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,A small price to pay for salvation.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,You're insane.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,You don't know that!,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"[scowls as hs egotistical narcissism prevents him from fully listening to her] I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. [he stands again and walks back to Gamora] For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,I'm sorry I disappointed you.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it. [leans down to put their heads at a level, whispering fiercely] But because you did. [looks at her] And you lied.",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Nebula.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Don't do this.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Please don't do this.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"Stop. Stop it. [she puts her hands on the gauntlet, pulling it down] I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.",avengers_infinity_war
memory nebula,"You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.",avengers_infinity_war
memory gamora,He can never get them all.,avengers_infinity_war
memory nebula,He will!,avengers_infinity_war
memory gamora,"He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.",avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"[to Gamora, walking around behind her] You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. [his voice drips with disgust] Where is the Soul Stone? [He raises his gauntlet next to Gamora's face. Nebula shakes her head, expression terrified, to encourage her sister's silence but when Gamora does not answer, Thanos clenches the gauntlet again, brow furrowed at his adopted daughter as the Power and Space Stoes are reactivated. Gamora grimaces in shared pain at her sister's screams, growing louder as Thanos increases the pressure.]",avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"Vormir! [Thanos unclenches his hand, and Nebula gasps in air as her parts snap back almost into place. Gamora goes to her and caresses her face.] The Stone is on Vormir.",avengers_infinity_war
thanos,[satisfied.] Show me.,avengers_infinity_war
groot,[irritably] I am Groot.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.,avengers_infinity_war
groot,[still irritably] I am Groot.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"[while looking out the rear portholes] Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,You speak Groot?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.",avengers_infinity_war
groot,[shortly] I am Groot.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. [nostalgically] It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"[to himself] Okay, time to be the captain. [walks to a console near by Thor], presses two buttons] So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,And you said your sister and your dad?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Both dead.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"Still got a mom, though?",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Killed by a dark elf.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,A best friend?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Stabbed through the heart.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"[smiling widely but also trying to convince himself] Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret...They're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is.",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Well, he's never fought me.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"Yeah, he has!",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,Better be some hammer.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,And what if you're wrong?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,[under his breath] I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. [Rocket takes an eyeball from somewhere on his person] Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... You're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. [he gives Thor the eyeball],avengers_infinity_war
Thor,What's this?,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,He gave you his eye?,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Thank you, sweet rabbit.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...[beeping] Hey, we're here!",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,[Smacking his palm against the side of his head to get the eye calibrated] I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,It ain't the eye.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries...,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"[pauses, looking at a pedestal] You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Yes. Why?,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"Look anything like that? [in fact, it looks exactly like that]",avengers_infinity_war
groot,[uneasily] I am Groot.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,[urgently] Go back to the pod.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Eitri, wait! Stop!",avengers_infinity_war
eitri,Thor?,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,What happened here?,avengers_infinity_war
eitri,You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Asgard is destroyed. [Thor scrambles to his feet and points. Eitri stop his attack on Thor. He now believes Thanos had destroyed Asgard and leaving him in a similar survivor role like Eitri himself.] Eitri, the glove. What did you do?",avengers_infinity_war
eitri,"[he walks brokenly across the space to sit heavily, leaning against an ore skip. Rocket and Groot get to their feet, the sapling checking his game.] 300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. ""Your life is yours."" he said. ""But your hands are mine alone."" [he holds up his immobile metal fists, encased in hardened molten metal]",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've designed, every axe, hammer, sword...It's all inside your head. Now I know all hope feels lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.",avengers_infinity_war
Nebula,"Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"[to Tony] Hey, what's going on?",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,I think we're here.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,I don't think this rig has a self-park function. [urgently] Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Yep, got it.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,Okay. Okay. Ready.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,[to e] You alright? [Panting] That was close. I owe you one.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I end up eating you, I'm sorry.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,[while pointing at Peter] I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,I'm trying to say that... something is coming.,avengers_infinity_war
Drax,"[yelling] THANOS!!!! [he flings a blade at Doctor e, who neatly deflects it with a mystical shield, and in return sends the Cloak of Levitation at Drax's face, half-smothering him and throwing him to the floor.

Drax,"[struggling with the Cloak of Levitation] Die, blanket of death!",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Alright, everybody, stay where you are... Chill the F out. [Quill powers off his helmet] I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[de-helmeting] Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,I'll do you one better! Why is Gamora?!,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! [Tony extends his nanotech cannon, looking uncannily like an electric shark about to eat Drax's face]",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,"Do it, Quill! I can take it.",avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,"No, he can't take it!",avengers_infinity_war
Steven e,[completely deadpan] She's right. You can't.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. [to Spidey] Starting with you.,avengers_infinity_war
Steven e,What master do you serve?,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? ""Jesus""?",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,[getting it] You're from Earth?,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Yeah, that's on EARTH, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"[sounding slightly crushed] So, you're not with Thanos?",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"[indignantly] WITH Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl. Wait... who are you?",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"[de-helmets] We're the Avengers, man.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,Oh.,avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,You're the ones Thor told us about!,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,You know Thor!?,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,[pause] Where is he now?,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,This is plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?,avengers_infinity_war
eitri,"It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Did it have a name?,avengers_infinity_war
eitri,Stormbreaker.,avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,That's a bit much.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,So how do we make it?,avengers_infinity_war
eitri,You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.,avengers_infinity_war
Thor,"Rabbit, fire up the pod.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,"I stopped listening after you said, ""We need a plan.""",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[to Quill] Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"See, ""not winging it"" isn't really what they do.",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Uh, what exactly is it that they do?",avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,"[as fiercely as an 8-week-old kitten] Kick names, take ass.",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,"Yeah, that's right. [agrees quietly as he settles into a stance facing the Avengers]",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"[Iron Man pauses with an expression of deep hopelessness] Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"""Mr. Lord."" Star-Lord is fine. [motions to Drax and Mantis]",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good. [Spider-Man follows the conversation back and forth like a squash rally.]",avengers_infinity_war
Drax,Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,What dance-off?,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Like in Footloose, the movie?",avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,[excitedly] Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,It never was.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,"Don't encourage this, alright?",avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,Okay.,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,"Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. [Quill points at Stark and Parker] So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,Your math is blowing my mind.,avengers_infinity_war
Mantis,"Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?",avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,e! We alright?,avengers_infinity_war
Tony Stark,You're back. You're alright.,avengers_infinity_war
peter parker,"Hey, what was that?",avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,[panting] I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.,avengers_infinity_war
peter quill,How many did you see?,avengers_infinity_war
doctor e,"14,000,605.",avengers_infinity_war

thanos,You know us?,avengers_infinity_war
stonekeeper,It is my curse to know all who journey here.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,Where's the Soul Stone?,avengers_infinity_war
stonekeeper,You should know... it extracts a terrible price.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,I am prepared.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,How is it you know this place so well?,avengers_infinity_war
red skull,"A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.",avengers_infinity_war
red skull,What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,What's this?,avengers_infinity_war
red skull,The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,Tell me what it needs.,avengers_infinity_war
red skull,To ensure that whoever possesses it... Understands its power... The stone demands a sacrifice.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,Of what?,avengers_infinity_war
red skull,In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul...For a soul.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,"All my life, I dreamed of a day...A moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now...You kill and torture...And you call it mercy.

thanos,[turns to face Gamora with tears in his eyes],avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,Really? Tears?,avengers_infinity_war
red skull,They're not for him.,avengers_infinity_war
Gamora,No. This isn't love.,avengers_infinity_war
thanos,"[thoroughly convicted.] I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you. [Gamora stares down unseeing for a moment, then up at the resolution on his face.

okoye,The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,[to Rhodey] Should we bow?,avengers_infinity_war
james rhodes,"[seriously] Yeah, he's a king.",avengers_infinity_war
Steve Rogers,Seems like I'm always thanking you for something. [shaking hands with T'Challa],avengers_infinity_war
james rhodes,[mock shocked] What are you doing?,avengers_infinity_war
T'challa,"Uh, we don't do that here. [He dissuades Bruce with a motion of his hand; Bruce shoots Rhodey a look, and is answered with a big grin] So how big of an assault can we expect?",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.",avengers_infinity_war
Natasha Romanov,How we looking?,avengers_infinity_war

Bucky Barnes,"Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.",avengers_infinity_war
shuri,Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.",avengers_infinity_war
shuri,Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?,avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"[uncertainly] Because, we didn't think of it.",avengers_infinity_war
shuri,"[reassuringly, with a smile] I'm sure you did your best.",avengers_infinity_war
Wanda Maximoff,Can you do it?,avengers_infinity_war
shuri,"Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. [to T'Challa] It will take time, brother.",avengers_infinity_war

T'challa,"Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures. [he stops, turns, and points at Cap] And get this man a shield.",avengers_infinity_war
Rocket Raccoon,"I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.",avengers_infinity_war
Thor,Leave that to me.,avengers_infinity_war

Natasha Romanov,"How we looking, Bruce?",avengers_infinity_war
Bruce Banner,"[leaping jogging along, keeping up with the carriers, and utterly delighted] Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow!

toomes,"I’ll bet you were glad when your old pal Spider-Man showed up in the elevator, though, huh?",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Yeah, well, I actually didn’t go up. I saw it all from the ground.",spiderman_homecoming

toomes,"Love you, gumdrop.",spiderman_homecoming
liz,Have a safe flight.,spiderman_homecoming
liz,Hi! You guys look so pretty.,spiderman_homecoming
toomes,Does she know?,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,Know what?,spiderman_homecoming
toomes,So she doesn’t. Good. Close to the vest. I admire that. I’ve got a few secrets of my own. Of all the reasons I didn’t want my daughter to date...,spiderman_homecoming
toomes,"Peter, nothing is more important than family. You saved my daughter’s life. I could never forget something like that. So I’m gonna give you one chance. Are you ready? You walk through those doors, you forget any of this happened. And don’t you ever, ever interfere with my business again. Because if you do, I’ll kill you and everybody you love. I’ll kill you dead. That’s what I’ll do to protect my family. Do you understand?",spiderman_homecoming
toomes,"Hey. I just saved your life. Now, what do you say?",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,Thank you.,spiderman_homecoming

Peter Parker,Why did he send you here?,spiderman_homecoming
schultz,Guess you’ll never know.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,Nice shot!,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Yes! Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz’s dad.",spiderman_homecoming
ned,What?,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"I know. I gotta tell Mr. Stark. Call Happy Hogan. He’s Mr. Stark’s head of security. And, uh, get a computer to track my phone for me.",spiderman_homecoming
ned,Are you gonna be okay?,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Hurry, we gotta catch him before he leaves town.",spiderman_homecoming
flash,"I’m sorry about dinner, but I know when branzino’s fresh, and that was not fresh, okay? So...",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"(in a gravelly voice) Flash, I need your car and your phone.",spiderman_homecoming
flash,"Uh, sir, technically, this is my dad’s car, sir. So I can’t...",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"(in a normal voice) Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, hey, hey, can you hear me?",spiderman_homecoming
ned,Go for Ned.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Ned, I need you to track my phone for me.",spiderman_homecoming

Peter Parker,"Hey, where are the headlights on this thing? I’m in Flash’s car.",spiderman_homecoming
ned,I’ll pull the specs.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Okay, you’re on speakerphone.",spiderman_homecoming
ned,You stole Flash’s car. Awesome.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Yeah, it’s awesome. It’s awe... Whoa!",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Get out of the way, get out of the way! Move! Move!",spiderman_homecoming
ned,"Peter, are you okay?",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,I’ve never really driven before. Only with May in parking lots. This is a huge step up...,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?",spiderman_homecoming
ned,Yeah. I’m working on it. I just gotta backdoor the phone system.,spiderman_homecoming
ned,Guy in the chair.,spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,Takeoff in nine minutes. (to Ned) Hello? Hello? Who is this?,spiderman_homecoming
ned,"Uh... Mr. Happy, it’s Ned.",spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,Who?,spiderman_homecoming
ned,I’m an associate of Peter Parker. Got something very important to tell you-,spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,You gotta be shitting me.,spiderman_homecoming
ned,Damn.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Hey, Ned, how we coming on with those headlights?",spiderman_homecoming
ned,"Uh... Round knob to the left of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Left. Okay. Okay, perfect. So where’s my phone now?",spiderman_homecoming
ned,Um... He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,What? That makes no sense. I thought he said he was going out of town!,spiderman_homecoming
ned,"Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy. Don’t think he likes you, by the way. It sounded like he was catching a flight. He said something about taking off in nine minutes.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,What?,spiderman_homecoming
ned,He was surrounded by a bunch of boxes.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,Boxes? It’s moving day. It’s moving day! It’s moving day! He’s gonna rob that plane! I gotta stop him!,spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,"All right, wheels up in eight minutes. We just got to load Tony’s old Hulkbuster armor, prototype for Cap’s new shield, and the Meging... the Meg... the... Thor’s magic belt.",spiderman_homecoming
ned,"Okay, slow down. You’re getting close. It’s on your right.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,What?,spiderman_homecoming
ned,Turn right! Turn right!,spiderman_homecoming

toomes,"Oh, hey, Pete. I didn’t hear you come in.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,It’s over. I’ve got you.,spiderman_homecoming
toomes,"You know, I gotta tell you, Pete, I really, really admire your grit. I see why Liz likes you. I do. When you first came to the house, I wasn’t sure. I thought, “Really?” But I get it now.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,How could you do this to her?,spiderman_homecoming
toomes,"To her? I’m not doing anything to her, Pete. I’m doing this for her.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Huh, yeah.",spiderman_homecoming
toomes,"(sighs) Peter, you’re young. You don’t understand how the world works.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Yeah, but I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong.",spiderman_homecoming
toomes,"How do you think your buddy Stark paid for that tower? Or any of his little toys? Those people, Pete, those people up there, the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want. Guys like us, like you and me, they don’t care about us. We build their roads and we fight all their wars and everything, but they don’t care about us. We have to pick up after ‘em. We have to eat their table scraps. That’s how it is. I know you know what I’m talking about, Peter.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,Why are you telling me this?,spiderman_homecoming
toomes,Because I want you to understand. And... I needed a little time to get her airborne.,spiderman_homecoming
toomes,"I’m sorry, Peter.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,What are you talking about? That thing hasn’t even touched me yet.,spiderman_homecoming
toomes,"True. Then again, wasn’t really trying to.",spiderman_homecoming

Peter Parker,"Oh, god. Okay, ready?",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Hello! Hello! Please. Hey, hey, please. I’m down here. I’m down here. I’m stuck. I’m stuck. I can’t move. I can’t...",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Come on, Peter. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man!",spiderman_homecoming

toomes,"Got a visual on the plane, feeling a little resistance.",spiderman_homecoming
mason,It’s probably just a drag on the new turbines.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,Ah! Whoa!,spiderman_homecoming
mason,Look out for the cloaking cameras. Stay in the blind spots.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Oh, my god! Oh, my god!",spiderman_homecoming

Happy Hogan,"Okay, thank you. All right.",spiderman_homecoming
toomes,Hot dog.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,Just a typical homecoming on the outside of an invisible jet... Fighting my girlfriend’s dad.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Oh, god!",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,Whew. I can’t believe that worked.,spiderman_homecoming
mason,"Chief, chief, they’re losing altitude. Get out of there.",spiderman_homecoming
toomes,I’m not going home empty-handed.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Oh, my god.",spiderman_homecoming
mason,Get out of there! What are you doing?,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,Please turn! Please turn!,spiderman_homecoming
toomes,"Hey, Pedro.",spiderman_homecoming
toomes,Bingo.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,Your wing suit. Your wing suit’s gonna explode!,spiderman_homecoming

Peter Parker,I’m trying to save you!,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,No.,spiderman_homecoming
ned,"It looked so insane. That whole... Like, it was just crazy. He, he was just like, “Zzzz,” and you were like, “Ah!”",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,Shh.,spiderman_homecoming
ned,"And then I just hit him with the “pew.” It was so, oh, my god.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,You saved me. It was awesome.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Hey, Liz!",spiderman_homecoming
betty,I’m gonna miss you.,spiderman_homecoming

Peter Parker,Liz.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Liz, look. I’m so sorry.",spiderman_homecoming
liz,You say that a lot. What are you sorry for this time?,spiderman_homecoming
liz,The dance? That was a pretty crappy thing to do.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Well, yeah, but I... I mean, your dad... I can’t imagine what you’re going through. If there’s anything I can do to help...",spiderman_homecoming
liz,"(fighting tears) I guess we’re moving to Oregon. Mom says it’s nice there, so that’s cool. Anyways, Dad doesn’t want us here during the trial, so...",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Liz, I... I...",spiderman_homecoming
liz,"Bye, Peter. Whatever’s going on with you, I hope you figure it out.",spiderman_homecoming
mr. harrington,"Congratulations, Decathlon national champions.",spiderman_homecoming
decathlon team,(clapping) Yeah!,spiderman_homecoming
mr. harrington,"I’m gonna have to put this back in the trophy case soon, but just for motivation right now at this practice. I’m a little ahead of the game, but we will need a new team captain next year. So I’m appointing Michelle.",spiderman_homecoming
decathlon team,Yeah!,spiderman_homecoming
michelle,"Uh, thank you. My friends call me M.J.",spiderman_homecoming
ned,I thought you didn’t have any friends.,spiderman_homecoming

Peter Parker,I... I gotta go.,spiderman_homecoming
michelle,"Hey, where you going?",spiderman_homecoming
michelle,"What are you hiding, Peter?",spiderman_homecoming
michelle,"I’m just kidding. I don’t care. Bye. (to Decathlon team) All right, so we should run some drills.",spiderman_homecoming
ned,Yeah.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Hey, Happy. What, uh... What are you doing here?",spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,"I really owe you one. I don’t know what I would do without this job. I mean, before I met Tony-",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"So, uh, how long you been here?",spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,(whispers) Is he here too?,spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,"In the toilet? No, he’s upstate.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Upstate? Like, upstate-upstate?",spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,"Yeah, let’s go.",spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,"Take a look. It’s pretty impressive, huh?",spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,They just finished remodeling the whole thing.,spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,You don’t see that every day.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"Oh, there they are. How was the ride up?",spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,Good.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,Give me a minute with the kid.,spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,Seriously?,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,Yeah. I gotta talk to the kid.,spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,I’ll be close behind.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"Sorry I took your suit. I mean, you had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was the perfect sort of tough-love moment that you needed, right? To urge you on, right? Wouldn’t you think? Don’t you think?",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Yeah, yeah, I guess.",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,Let’s just say it was.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Mr. Stark, I really-",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"You screwed the pooch hard. Big time. But then you did the right thing. Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies... All right, not my best analogy. (beat) I was wrong about you. I think, with a little more mentoring, you could be a real asset to the team.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,To the... To the team?,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"Yeah. Anyway... (points at a door) There’s about fifty reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers.",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,Spider-Man.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,I...,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,Yeah. Give that a look.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"So, after the press conference, Happy will show you to your room, your new quarters. (to Happy) Where’s he between? He’s next to Vision?",spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,"Yeah, Vision’s not big on doors.",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,It’s fun.,spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,Or walls.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,(to Peter) You’ll fit right in.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Thank you, Mr. Stark. But I’m good.",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,You’re good? Good? How are you good?,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Well, I mean, I’m... I’d rather just stay on the ground for a little while. Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Somebody’s got to look out for the little guy, right?",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"You turning me down? You better think about this. (pointing at the new Spider-Man suit) Look at that. Look at me. Last chance, yes or no?",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,No.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"Okay. It’s kind of a Springsteen-y, working class hero vibe that I dig. Uh, Happy will take you home. Yeah?",spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,Yeah. (to Peter) Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Thank you, Mr. Stark.",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"Yes, Mr. Parker. Very well.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,See you around.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,Okay.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"That was a test, right? There’s, uh, nobody back there?",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"Yes, you passed. All right, skedaddle there, young buck.",spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you.",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"Yeah, thank you.",spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,Told you he’s a good kid.,spiderman_homecoming
Pepper Potts,Where’s the kid?,spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,He left.,spiderman_homecoming
Pepper Potts,Everybody’s waiting.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,You know what? He actually made a really mature choice. It just surprised the heck out of us.,spiderman_homecoming
Pepper Potts,Did you guys screw this up?,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,(points at Happy) He told the kid to go wait in the car.,spiderman_homecoming
Pepper Potts,Are you kidding me? I have a room full of people in there waiting for some big announcement. What am I gonna tell them?,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"Think of something. How about, um... Hap, you still got that ring?",spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,"Do I... I, uh...",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,The engagement ring?,spiderman_homecoming
Happy Hogan,Are you kidding? I’ve been carrying this since 2008.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,Okay.,spiderman_homecoming
Pepper Potts,I think I can think of something better than that.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"Well, it would buy us a little time.",spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,Like we need time.,spiderman_homecoming
Pepper Potts,I can’t believe you have that thing in your pocket.,spiderman_homecoming
Tony Stark,"Want me to get the door for you, hon?",spiderman_homecoming
Pepper Potts,I got it.,spiderman_homecoming
Peter Parker,"Aunt May, did you do dinner already?",spiderman_homecoming

may,What the fu...?,spiderman_homecoming
gargan,"Look who it is! What are the odds you and I’d end up in the same summer camp? Relax. This? (points at the scar on his forehead) It’s not on you. It’s on our, uh... little spider friend. I’ve got some boys on the outside who would love to meet him. You know, take a picture, slice his throat, put his head in a dryer. And I heard a rumor... you know who he is.",spiderman_homecoming
toomes,"If I knew who he was, he’d already be dead.",spiderman_homecoming
guard,"Toomes, your family’s here.",spiderman_homecoming
Steve Rogers,Hi. I’m Captain America. Here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have. Patience. Sometimes patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little. It seems like it’s not worth it. And you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.,spiderman_homecoming
Steve Rogers,How many more of these?,spiderman_homecoming
Clint Barton,"Okay, hold on. Don't shoot. You see where you're going?",avengers_engame
lila,Mhm. ,avengers_engame
Clint Barton,"Okay, now let's worry about how you get there. [Clint corrects his daughter's foot to the proper position, and adjusts her shooting stance.]",avengers_engame
Clint Barton,Put your foot this way. Here. Can you see?,avengers_engame
lila,Yeah.,avengers_engame
Clint Barton,You sure?,avengers_engame
lila,Mhm. [Clint pushes Lila's hair in front of her face while covering her left eye.],avengers_engame

laura,"Nice throw, kiddo.",avengers_engame
cooper,You go.,avengers_engame
laura,"Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both? [Camera switches to Lila who then proceeds to look at Clint.]",avengers_engame
lila,Who wants mayo on a hotdog?,avengers_engame
Clint Barton,Probably your brothers. ,avengers_engame
Clint Barton,"Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama. [Camera switches to Laura facing Nathaniel]",avengers_engame
laura,Mayo or mustard?,avengers_engame
nathaniel,How about ketchup?,avengers_engame
laura,Ketchup? [Camera switches back to Clint and his daughter],avengers_engame

Clint Barton,"Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow.",avengers_engame
laura,"Hey guys! Enough practice, soup's on!",avengers_engame
Clint Barton,"Alright, we're coming; we're hungry. [Clint looks behind him, but there's no one there, but dust being blown away by the wind.]",avengers_engame
Clint Barton,"Lila, let's go. [Clint starts to look around]",avengers_engame
Clint Barton,"Lila? [Clint starts to move and look around, and pick up the bow she had.]",avengers_engame
Clint Barton,"Honey? Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura?",avengers_engame
Nebula,"Wrra! [Nebula, frustrated, puts her hands in a fighting stance while looking at Tony]",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony],avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Oh yeah, that was close. [Nebula once again flicks a paper football towards Tony]",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,That's a goal. You're now one a piece.,avengers_engame
Nebula,I would like to try again. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony],avengers_engame
Tony Stark,We tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun. ,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. [Nebula flicks the paper football towards Tony],avengers_engame
Tony Stark,And... you've won. Congratulations.  [Tony reaches his hand out to shake Nebula's hand],avengers_engame
Tony Stark,Fair game. Good sport. [Nebula shakes Tony's hand],avengers_engame
Tony Stark,Have fun?,avengers_engame
Nebula,It was fun. ,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,This thing on? [The helmet scans Tony. Tony leans against the wall while taking deep breaths. He looks weak and malnutrition.],avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Hey, Miss Potts... Pep.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're... if you're still... Oh god,  I hope so.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Today is day 21, uh 22. [Cut to Tony standing at a window to stare out in space, waiting for his impending doom to arrive.]",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there. [Cut to a shot of Nebula sitting in the back of the Benatar.]",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time. [A shot of Tony and Nebual working on the fuel cells of the Benatar.]",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7 -11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hooping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. It's always you.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,I couldn't stop him.,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Neither could I.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,I lost the kid.,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Tony, we lost.",avengers_engame

Pepper Potts,Oh my god! [She and Tony embrace.],avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"It's okay. [In the Avengers Compound. The heroes are sitting in a living room area. Tony is sitting at a table, getting blood for healing.]",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth. World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census.

Tony Stark,Where is he now? Where?,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,We don't know.,avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,"He just opened a portal and walked through. [Cut to a shot of a sullen looking Thor, sitting on a bench, seemingly deep in thought.]",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,What's wrong with him?,avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,"He's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but there's a lot of that's goin' around, ain't there?",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Honestly, until this exact second, I though you were a Build-A-Bear.",avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,Maybe I am.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans and satellites, and we got nothing.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Tony, you fought him.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Who told you that? I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the stone. That's what happened. There was no fight.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need. ,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling you, Cap.",avengers_engame
Rhodey,"Tony, Tony, Tony, stop!",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,Otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Wether it impacted our precious freedom or not- that's what we needed!,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Well, that didn't work out, did it?",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"I said, ""we'll lose"". You said, ""We'll do that together too."" And guess what, cap? We lost. You weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers, right?",avengers_engame
Rhodey,"Okay, you made your point. Just sit down, ok?",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Nah, nah, nah. [He pushes Rhodey away] Here's my point.",avengers_engame
Rhodey,Sit down!,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"[Referring to Carol] She's great, by the way. We need you. You're new blood. ",avengers_engame
Rhodey,Tony!,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Bunch of tired old mills! I got nothing for you, cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no plan, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar. ",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Tony!,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,I'm fine. I...,avengers_engame
Rhodey,Bruce gave him sedative. He's gonna be out for the rest of the day.,avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,You guys take care of him. And I'll bring Xorrian Elixir when I come back.,avengers_engame
Rhodey,Where are you going?,avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,To kill Thanos.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"You know, we usually work as a team around here, and between you and I, we're also a little fragile. We realize this is more your territory, but this is our fight too.",avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,Do you even know where he is?,avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,I know people who might.,avengers_engame
Nebula,To the Garden.,avengers_engame
Rhodey,"That's cute, Thanos has a retirement plan.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,So where is he then?,avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,"When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago. [A hologram of a planet pops up, with a shockwave visibly traversing the surface.]",avengers_engame
Nebula,On this planet. Thanos is there.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,He used the stones again.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Hey, Hey, we'd be going in short-handed, you know.",avengers_engame
Rhodey,"Look, he's still got the stones, so...",avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,So let's get him. We'll use them to bring everyone back.,avengers_engame
Rhodey,Just like that?,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Yeah, just like that.",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?",avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,"Because before, you didn't have me.",avengers_engame
Rhodey,"Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time.",avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,"There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.",avengers_engame
Thor,I like this one.,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Let's go get this son of a bitch. [Cut to a shot of everyone except for Carol and Tony aboard the Benatar.],avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,"Okay, who here hasn't been to space? [Nat, Cap, and Rhodey raise their hands.]",avengers_engame
Rhodey,Why?,avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,You better not throw up on my ship. Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1!,avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,I'll head down for ground recon.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"This is gonna work, Steve.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,I know it will.,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Because I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.,avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,"No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It's just him.",avengers_engame
Nebula,Then that's enough.,avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,Oh no.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,Where are they?,avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,Answer the question!,avengers_engame
thanos,"The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,You murdered trillions!,avengers_engame
thanos,You should be thankful.,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Where are the stones?,avengers_engame
thanos,Gone. Reduced to atoms.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,You used them two days ago!,avengers_engame
thanos,I used the stones to destroy the stones. It... nearly killed me. But the work is done. it always will be. I am inevitable.,avengers_engame
Rhodey,"We have to tear this place apart, he has to be lying.",avengers_engame
Nebula,My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.,avengers_engame
thanos,"Thank you, daughter. Perhaps I treated you too harshly.",avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,What... What did you do?,avengers_engame
Thor,I went for the head.,avengers_engame
man #1,"So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. First time in five years, you know? Sit there, dinner... I didn't know what to talk about.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,What did you talk about?,avengers_engame
man #1,"Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. Then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads.",avengers_engame
man #2,How about you?,avengers_engame
man #1,"I cried just before dessert. But I'm seeing him tomorrow, so...",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. [Another man during the therapy session is seen starting to tear up.] And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps you gotta take. To try and become whole again. To try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You got to move on. Got to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we have to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed us all.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"[grunts as he pushes away a cushion out of his body, and deactivates the helmet, but still grunting in pain, as he sweeps away sparks from an electrical failure out of his suit, then try to stand up.] What the hell?",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,Hope?,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,[yells] Kid! Hey kid!,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,What the hell happened here?,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"No. Please. Please, please. [moves on to check the other side of the engraved stone] No, no, no. No. [Lang excuses aside a young couple as he keeps on checking another engraved stone if her daughter hadn't had her name on one.] Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"[in a mantra-like] Please, please, please, please... No, Cassie. [Lang looks at the engraved stone in shock, revealing his name in it.]",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,What?,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,Cassie?,avengers_engame
cassie,"Dad? [Both of them emotionally hug each other as both dad and daughter had reunited. Then Lang shoves her back, realizing that her daughter is now a full-grown teenager.]",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,You're so big!,avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,"Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship that Danvers pinged.",avengers_engame
Nebula,It was an infectious garbage scowl.,avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,"So, thanks for the hot tip. [turns to Danvers and replies back with a smirk]",avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,"Well, you were closer.",avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,Yeah. And we smell like garbage.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,[turns to Okoye] You get a reading on those tremors?,avengers_engame
okoye,It was a mild subduction under the African plate.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?,avengers_engame
okoye,"Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it.",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"[turns to Danvers] Carol, are we seeing you here next month?",avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,Not likely.,avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,"[realizing that she got a new haircut] What, you gonna get a new haircut?",avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,"[irritated] Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets.",avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,[murmurs to himself] That's a good point. That's a good point.,avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,So you might not see me for a long time.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me.",avengers_engame
okoye,Okay.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"Alright. [One by one, the Avengers cut off their calls one by one...]",avengers_engame
Carol Danvers,Good luck. [cuts off call],avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,Where are you?,avengers_engame
Rhodey,Mexico. The federales found a room filled with bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,It's probably a rival gang.,avengers_engame
Rhodey,Except it isn't. [Nat realizes something.],avengers_engame
Rhodey,"It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left...",avengers_engame
Rhodey,"I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him.",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,Will you find out where he's going next?,avengers_engame
Rhodey,Nat...,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,Please.,avengers_engame
Rhodey,[reluctantly] Okay. [then Rhodes cuts off his] [Nat starts to cry as she tries to hold back her tears miserably.],avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already. [Out of nowhere, Roger slumps over a bookshelf, in the same mood as he is in the therapy session, as Nat wipes off the tears off her face.]",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,You here to do your laundry?,avengers_engame
rogers,And to see a friend.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"[referring to herself] Clearly, your friend is fine.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,In the Hudson?,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"There's fewer ships, cleaner water.",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. [jokingly smiles, as Rogers does the same]",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"[Walks and talks to her...] Sorry. Force of habit. [...and throws his jacket, then sits down on another chair.]",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"You know, I keep telling everyone they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us.",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"If I move on, who does this?",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Maybe it doesn't need to be done.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,[Deep in her thoughts] I used to have nothing. Then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,We both need to get a life.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,[Smiling] You first.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Uh... Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn't recognize me.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,[Standing up] Is this an old message?,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,[Also standing up] It's the front gate.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Ant-man? Ant-man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Are you okay?,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,Yeah. I'm fine.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,Have either of you ever studied Quantum Physics?,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,Only in mid-conversation.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she's my... She was my... [struggling to not tell the entire truth about their relationship] She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there.",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Yeah, but that's just it. For me it was five hours.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Scott, what are you talking about?",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Wait, are you talking about a time machine?",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... No, it's crazy.",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,So who do we talk to about this?,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,Chow time! [He seems to be speaking to someone unknown by the audience.],avengers_engame
Tony Stark,Morgoona? Morgan H. Stark.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Want some lunch? Define lunch or be disintegrated. [She puts on a helmet similar to Iron Man, with white replacing the red.]",avengers_engame
morgan,Okay.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. [Takes the helmet off Morgan's head. She emerges out smiling mischievously.] There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? Want a handful of crickets?",avengers_engame
morgan,No.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,That's what you want. How did you find this?,avengers_engame
morgan,Garage.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,Really? Were you looking for it?,avengers_engame
morgan,No. I found it though.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Mum never wears anything I wear.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"[Cut to after Scott's plan has been explained to Tony] Now, we know what it sounds like...",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck scale, which then triggers the Deutsch proposition. Can we agree on that?",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Thank-you. In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,I did.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,[looking embarrassed] A time heist?,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,The stones are in the past. We can go back and get them.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,I don't believe we would.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,No.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,Tony... We have to take a stand.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"We did stand. And yet, here we are.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did. And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. Bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even...",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"That's right, Scott, I won't. Leave it. Got a kid.",avengers_engame
morgan,Mommy told me to come and save you.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Good job. I'm saved. [Turning to face Cap, Nat and Scott.] I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,He's scared.,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,He's not wrong.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna top?",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"[Incredulous, pointing to Tony's house] Bigger than his?",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating. [Pushing a plate forward] Try some of that. Have some eggs.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,I'm so confused.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,[seriously] These are confusing times.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Right. No, no, that's not what I meant.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"[dropping the act] No, I get it. I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy. I'm wearing shirts now.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,Yeah! How? Why?,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Five years ago, we got our asses beat. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost.",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"No one blamed you, Bruce.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Bets of both worlds...",avengers_engame
girl,"Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,Yes?,avengers_engame
girl,Can we get a photo?,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"100%, little person. Come on, step up. [Holding out the phone to Scott] You mind?",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,Oh.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Say ""green""! [The children and Bruce say Green as Scott snaps the photo.]",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,Did you get that? That's good.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,[leaning forward to hand back the phone] Don't you wanna grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Wait, no, no, he wants to... [to one of the boys] You want to take a picture with him, right? [The boy shakes his head vigorously.]",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,He's even saying no he doesn't. I get it. I don't want it either. I don't want a picture with them.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,[To the children] He's gonna feel bad. [To Scott] Sorry. They said they'd do it.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,I don't want it anymore.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,You'd feel bad.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,Just take the goddamn phone.,avengers_engame
girl,"Thank you, Mr. Hulk.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"No, it's great kids. Thank you very much. Hulk out!",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Bruce.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,[Awkwardly] Dab!,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Bruce.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,Listen to your Mom. She knows better.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,About we were saying...,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Right. The whole time travel do-over? Guys, it's outside my area of expertise.",avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please.",avengers_engame
friday,Processing...,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. Gotta take a second.",avengers_engame
friday,Just a moment.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -,avengers_engame
friday,Model rendered.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,Shit!,avengers_engame
morgan,Shit!,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"What are you doing up, little miss?",avengers_engame
morgan,Shit!,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her.",avengers_engame
morgan,Why you up?,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,'Cause I got some important shit going on here. What do you think? I got something on my mind.I got something on my mind.,avengers_engame
morgan,Was it Juice Pops?,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on... my mind. [In Morgan's room]",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"You done? Yeah, now you are. [Pushing Morgan's head onto her pillow] That face goes there.",avengers_engame
morgan,Tell me a story.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"A story. Once upon a time, a girl went to bed. The end.",avengers_engame
morgan,[Giggling] That ain't the whole story.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Come on, that's your favourite story. I love you tons.",avengers_engame
morgan,I love you 3000.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Wow. 3000. That's crazy. Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Not that it's a competition or anything, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 scale. [Pepper scoffs]",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,[Absentmindedly] What are you reading?,avengers_engame
Pepper Potts,"Oh, it's just a book on composting.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,[Still absentmindedly] What's new with composting?,avengers_engame
Pepper Potts,Just -,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"I figured it out, by the way.",avengers_engame
Pepper Potts,"You know, just so we're talking about the same thing -",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,Time travel.,avengers_engame
Pepper Potts,"What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,That's right.,avengers_engame
Pepper Potts,I got really lucky.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Yeah, I know.",avengers_engame
Pepper Potts,A lot of people didn't.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"No, I can't help everybody.",avengers_engame
Pepper Potts,It sorta seems like you can.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop.",avengers_engame
Pepper Potts,"Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.,avengers_engame
Pepper Potts,But would you be able to rest?,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... van thing.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose tiny here in the 1950s. [Scott, Nat and Cap give Bruce a panicked look]",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,Excuse me?,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,He's kidding. [To Bruce] You can't say things like that.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,Just... It was a bad joke.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"You were kidding, right?",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. [presses a few buttons] We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, you'll walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,Perfectly not confusing,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Good luck, Scott. You got this.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"You're right, Captain America, I do.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,On the count of three. 3... 2... 1!,avengers_engame
teen scott,Guys? This doesn't feel right.,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,What's going on?,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,Hold on.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,Who is that?,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Is that Scott?,avengers_engame
teen scott,"Yes, this is Scott!",avengers_engame
old scott,Ow! My back!,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Can you bring him back?,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,I'm working on it!,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,It's a baby.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,It's Scott.,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,As a baby!,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,He'll grow!,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Bring Scott back.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"[motioning to Nat] When I say kill the power, kill the power. And... Kill it!",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Somebody peed my pants. I don't know if it was ""baby"" me or ""old"" me. Or just ""me"" me.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,Time travel!,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,What?,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,I see this as an absolute win!,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,He turned into a baby.,avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"[Ignoring Steve's question] That's the EPR paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody shoulda cautioned you against it.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,You did.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"[Opening his car's trunk] Oh, did I? Thank god I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it. [He holds up his right hand, with a device on it] A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace. Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,Me too.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Bring back everyone? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And maybe not die trying will be nice.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Sounds like a deal. [Steve reaches out his hand to shake in the deal, in which Tony replies in the same way.]",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Tony, I don't know...",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Why? He made it for you. Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Thank you, Tony",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team. We are getting the whole team, yeah?",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,We're working on that right now.,avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,"Hey, humie! Where's Big Green?",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Uh, Kitchen, I think. [To himself as he sees Rocket with a gun] That's awesome. [He starts to eat his taco, but Nebula lands right in front of him at full speed. Everything inside the taco falls out as Scott gets spooked]",avengers_engame
Nebula,"[into an earpiece] Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot on the landing zone.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Oh, God!",avengers_engame
Rhodey,"What's up, regular sized man?",avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,Kind of a step down from a from a golden palace for an Avenger highness and whatnot.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Have a little compassion, pal. First they've lost Asgard, then half the people. They're probably just happy to have a home. [Bruce spots Valkyrie looking over at him, and heads over to her.]",avengers_engame
valkyrie,You shouldn't have come!,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl!",avengers_engame
valkyrie,[Noticing Bruce's change of appearance] I think I liked you better either of the other ways.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,[motioning to Rocket] This is Rocket.,avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,How you doin'?,avengers_engame
valkyrie,[Eyeing Rocket] He won't see you.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"That bad, huh?",avengers_engame
valkyrie,"We only see him once a month, when he comes for... [looking over to a pile of kegs on the side] ... supplies.",avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,It's that bad.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,Yeah.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,[Grimacing at the smell] What the...,avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,Woo! Something died in here.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,Hello? Thor?,avengers_engame
Thor,[From another room.] Are you here about the cable?,avengers_engame
Thor,"The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy. [He notices Bruce and Rocket standing there] Boys! Oh my God! How have you been? [To Rocket, trying to hug him] Come here, you little rascal!",avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,"No, I'm good. I'm good. That's not necessary.",avengers_engame
Thor,"Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right?",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Hey, boys!",avengers_engame
korg,"Hey guys. Long time no see. Beer's on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously. Thor, he's back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again.",avengers_engame
Thor,Noobmaster?,avengers_engame
korg,"Yeah, Noobmaster69.",avengers_engame
Thor,"Noobmaster? Yeah, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms then shove them up your butt! Oh, that's right. Yes, now go cry to your father, you little weasel!",avengers_engame
korg,"Thank you, Thor.",avengers_engame
Thor,"Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?",avengers_engame
korg,Thank you very much. I will.,avengers_engame
Thor,"So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Buddy, you all right?",avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,You look like melted ice cream.,avengers_engame
Thor,"[Laughs] So, what's up?",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything.,avengers_engame
Thor,"What, like the cable? [burps] Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,Like Thanos.,avengers_engame
Thor,Don't say that name.,avengers_engame
korg,"Um, yeah. We don't actually say that name in here.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"[quietly] Please take your hand off me. [He brushes away Thor's hand] Now, I know that... guy might scare you.",avengers_engame
Thor,"Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn't think so. Korg, why don't you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off.",avengers_engame
korg,Umm... Stormbreaker?,avengers_engame
Thor,"Now, who's swingin' Stormbreaker?",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? I've been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it?",avengers_engame
Thor,I don't know. Is it... Natasha?,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,It was you. You helped me.,avengers_engame
Thor,"[walks over and looks out the window and points, still holding his beer] Why don't you ask the, Asgardians down there, how much my help was worth. [he drops onto the sofa] The ones that are left, anyway.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,I think we can bring them back.,avengers_engame
Thor,"Stop. Just, stop... [opens a packet on m&ms] I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we?",avengers_engame
korg,"Nah, all good here, mate!",avengers_engame
Thor,"So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it, don't care, couldn't care less. Goodbye.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"[from offscreen] We need you, pal.",avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,[Crossing his arms] There's beer on the ship.,avengers_engame
Thor,"[pauses, but doesn't look up] What kind?",avengers_engame
ronin,[Also in Japanese] You're done hurting people.,avengers_engame
akihiko,You're crazy!,avengers_engame
akihiko,[In English] Wait! Help me! I'll do anything you want!,avengers_engame
ronin,"[Raising his katana, in English] What I want... You can't give me.",avengers_engame
Clint Barton,You shouldn't be here.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,Neither should you.,avengers_engame
Clint Barton,I've got a job to do.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,Is that what you're calling this? Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,"We found something. A chance, maybe...",avengers_engame
Clint Barton,[Now openly crying] Don't! Don't give me hope!,avengers_engame
Natasha Romanov,I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.,avengers_engame
Tony Stark,"[To Thor] Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski. [To Rocket, who's working on something underneath a glass platform] How's it going, Ratchet?",avengers_engame
Rocket Raccoon,"It's Rocket. Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,[Unfazed] Yup.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,Time travel suit? Not bad.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"[Response to Hulk touching the suit and something red in a glass tube] Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy!",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,I'm being very careful.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"No, you're being very Hulky.",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,I'm being careful.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"[Holding up the red glass bottle] These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more.",avengers_engame
Steve Rogers,"Scott, calm down!",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Sorry. We've got enough for one round trip each. That's it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs. [He accidentally presses a button, and shrinks, and then grows back to his normal size.] One test run.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,All right. I'm not ready for this.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,I'm game.,avengers_engame
Clint Barton,I'll do it.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift.",avengers_engame
Clint Barton,[Taking position on the platform] Don't worry about it.,avengers_engame
Rhodey,"Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, and...",avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"First of all, that's horrible.",avengers_engame
Rhodey,It's Thanos.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"And secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future.",avengers_engame
Rhodey,"Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved. Bingo.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,That's not how it works.,avengers_engame
Rhodey,"Well, that's what I heard.",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,What? By who? Who told you that?,avengers_engame
Rhodey,"Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time -",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,Quantum Leap -,avengers_engame
Rhodey,"A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time -",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,Hot Tub Time Machine -,avengers_engame
Rhodey,"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.",avengers_engame
Scott Lang,"Die Hard? No, it's not...",avengers_engame
Rhodey,This is known.,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future...",avengers_engame
Tony Stark,Exactly.,avengers_engame
Scott Lang,So... Back To The Future's a bunch of bullshit?,avengers_engame
Bruce Banner,"[Turning to Clint] Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1!",avengers_engame
lila,Cooper? Where are my headphones?,avengers_engame
Clint Barton,"[murmuring] Lila? [The device on his hand starts beeping, signalling the end of this visit] Lila! [He dives for the door, but only manages to open it before he shrinks back to go back to the future.]",avengers_engame

Scott Lang,"Okay. We're in. [A flashlight clicks and turns on, illuminating Scott's face. He shines the light around.] Aw, this place is a maze. Where's that map?

cassie,"I'm ready, Daddy.",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"Are you sure? Cause once we're inside, you show any hesitation or fear, we're done.",ant_man_wasp

Scott Lang,"No, no, not at all.",ant_man_wasp
Luis,You sure? 'Cause it's a lot of security cameras. ,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,I know what he needs. Who's the security expert in our business? ,ant_man_wasp
Luis,"You are, but I'm running the company, and if we oversell it, he's gonna go somewhere else. I mean, we gotta land this bird. ",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"He ain't goin' anywhere. And the expression is ""'land this fish.""",ant_man_wasp
Luis,"No. It's ""land the bird."" Just like you land a plane. You gotta land the plane to be in business. ",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"I know it's silly to get hung up on these kinds of things, but I do.",ant_man_wasp
Luis,"How am I gonna land a fish? It can't walk. And if it swam up on a shore, and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?",ant_man_wasp

[He flicks the card away before putting his hand behind Cassie's ear and making another Ace of Spades return to his hand. He tosses it behind again.] I learned that. ",ant_man_wasp
cassie,Why can't you just leave my daddy alone?,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"(sarcastically) Wow, you're really great with kids.",ant_man_wasp
woo,"Thanks, I'm also a youth pastor. [Scott's face snaps from a smile to confusion.] Anyway, not to be a Johnny Ask-A-Lot, but you haven't had any contact with Hank Pym or Hope van Dyne, have you?",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,No. ,ant_man_wasp
woo,"You sure? Because it's only a matter of time before we get 'em. It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too. And associating with them breaks your deal. And I don't need to remind you that any violation of your agreement means 20 years in prison. Minimum. ",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,I haven't talked to Hank or Hope in forever.,ant_man_wasp

Scott Lang,"Me too, Peanut. Just wait till next weekend. Once I'm outta here, we're gonna go paint this town red. We'll have so much ice cream, we'll never stop puking.

maggie,You're getting good at that.,ant_man_wasp
paxton,How'd you do that?,ant_man_wasp
cassie,"Bye, Daddy!",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,Three days... Easy-peasy.,ant_man_wasp
man in the video,"Snap your fingers. That gets them to look over there. Now that is misdirection. [Scott imitates the trick shown to him, shaking the deck and snapping his fingers. making the card change to a six of hearts. He  looks at the deck with satisfaction.]",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,Easy-peasy...,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,[voiceover] What?,ant_man_wasp
Janet van Dyne,"[voiceover] I'm gonna find you, Jellybean. [Young Hope can be heard giggling. A large, red wardrobe with horses on it comes into view. It is then opened by a hand extended into the camera's view. Hope is found inside.]  I found you!",ant_man_wasp
young hope,"You always find me, Mommy.",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,[voiceover] What the hell?,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"Hey, Hank. It's been a while. Umm... I don't even know if this is your number anymore... and, I'm probably the last person you wanna hear from. But... I just had a really weird dream. And I know that doesn't sound like an emergency or anything, but it just felt... very real. I was back in the Quantum Realm, and... I think I saw your wife. And then I was your wife. I mean, not in a weird way... You know... hearing this out loud, I'm thinking, it's not an emergency. I'm sorry to bother you. I'm sorry for a lot of things."" [Scott pulls the phone away from his ear and hangs up. He then snaps the phone in two and throws it away to make sure they don't trace the call back.]",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,(drowsily) Hope? [She looks over at Scott before turning back to the road.] Is this another dream?,ant_man_wasp
hope,"Do you think it's a dream, or is it possible that you really saw my Mom down there?",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"I'm not sure... [He suddenly remembers where he's supposed to be; at home. HIs eyes snap open.] I can't be here! I can't be, I'm under house arrest. [Scott tries to open the doors to the car.]",ant_man_wasp
hope,"They won't open while the system's engaged, Scott. [Scott yells as his passenger window is greeted with a pigeon eye. The care has shrunk down. Another car drives over it, unaware of what lurks beneath.] ",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,You have to take me home. They can show up any second.,ant_man_wasp
hope,"Relax. As far as your nanny cops know, you're still at home.",ant_man_wasp
Luis,Woah! Scotty?,ant_man_wasp
hope,"He's programmed to replicate your daily routine. Nine hours in bed, five hours in front of the TV, two hours in the bathroom -  whatever that's about.",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,(defensively)  That's totally inaccurate. And how do you know about my daily routine? Are you spying on me?,ant_man_wasp
hope,"(with sharpness) We keep tabs on all security threats, all right? And so far, the biggest one we've had is you.",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"I'm sorry about Germany. They just showed up. They said it was a matter of national security, that Cap needed help-",ant_man_wasp
hope,(as a scoff) Cap?,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"...tain America. Captain... Cap. It's what we call him. (cocky and self-inflating)  If you're a friend. I think I'm a friend, a little. I know him. He's nice. Whatever... I'm sorry! All right? I didn't think I'd get caught.",ant_man_wasp
hope,You didn't think about a lot of things.,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,How's Hank?,ant_man_wasp
hope,"We're still running, the house is gone. So is our freedom. How do you think he is?",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,I'm sorry. I know you're mad.,ant_man_wasp
hope,"I'm not looking for an apology, Scott. The only reason why we're even talking is because we need what's in your head.",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"Is this where you're living? If you need help, money or something, maybe I can...",ant_man_wasp
hope,We're fine.,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"Hey, Hank. Look... I just want to- ",ant_man_wasp
Dr. Hank Pym,Save it. Can we start?,ant_man_wasp
hope,"Yeah. So, while you were relaxing at home, we were building this. It's a tunnel. To the Quantum Realm. To my Mom. We think she might still be down there, we just don't know where.",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,What?,ant_man_wasp
hope,"If we can pinpoint my Mom's location, then the pod can take me down to get her.",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,You built all this and you don't even know if she's alive?,ant_man_wasp
Dr. Hank Pym,"It's called a hypothesis. Last night we powered up the tunnel for the first time. It overloaded, and it shut down. But for a split second, the doorway to the Quantum Realm was opened.",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,And?,ant_man_wasp

Scott Lang,"Hank, I would never do that. I respect you too much.",ant_man_wasp
Dr. Hank Pym,"Quantum entanglement, Scott.",ant_man_wasp
hope,"We think she might have put some kind of message in your head. Hopefully, a location. And opening the tunnel triggered it.",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,Your Mom put a message in my head? Come on. That's insane.,ant_man_wasp
Dr. Hank Pym,"No, Scott. Insane... is going to Germany without telling us and fighting the Avengers. Just tell me you weren't lying about the suit you took. Tell me you really destroyed it.",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,I did. I destroyed it. I swear.,ant_man_wasp
Dr. Hank Pym,I can't believe you destroyed my suit. That was my life's work.,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,What was I supposed to do?,ant_man_wasp
Dr. Hank Pym,You were supposed to not take my suit!,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"I'm sorry, Hank. I'm sorry I took the suit. I'm sorry that I called last night. I don't remember seeing Janet down there. I wish that I did. I just had a dream about her playing hide and seek with a little girl. [Hank and Hope stop walking and Hank turns to face Scott]",ant_man_wasp
hope,What?,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,I had a dream. She was playing hide and seek with a little... girl. Cassie and I do it all the time. It doesn't mean anything.,ant_man_wasp
hope,"But, was it Cassie in the dream?",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,No.,ant_man_wasp
hope,Where was she hiding?,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,What?,ant_man_wasp
hope,"The little girl, where was she hiding. Was it in a wardrobe?",ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"No, it's in a tall dresser.",ant_man_wasp
Dr. Hank Pym,You mean a wardrobe.,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,Is that what that's called?,ant_man_wasp
hope,What color was it?,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,Red.,ant_man_wasp
hope,Were there horses on it?,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"Oh, boy.",ant_man_wasp
hope,It's where I hid every time we played.,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,Doesn't sound like you really got the gist of the game.,ant_man_wasp
hope [to hank],She's alive!,ant_man_wasp
Dr. Hank Pym,I knew it. I knew it!,ant_man_wasp
hope,We need to get that part.,ant_man_wasp
Dr. Hank Pym,Okay. [,ant_man_wasp
hope,"The sooner we get the tunnel working, the sooner we can get this message out his head.",ant_man_wasp
Dr. Hank Pym,Does Burch have it?,ant_man_wasp
hope,Yeah. Let's go.,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"What part? Who's Burch? Wait, what's happening? [Hope and Hank pick up a few pieces of equipment and walk out of the building towards the car, followed by Scott]",ant_man_wasp
hope,We need a component to stop the tunnel from overloading again. I brought your clothes. You might wanna change.,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,Look. I'd really like to help you out. But if I'm not home when they come to take off my ankle monitor then I'm going away forever.,ant_man_wasp
hope,"Once we get the component and power up the tunnel, we'll get the message and have you home by lunch. We have to hurry. The entanglement won't last.",ant_man_wasp
Dr. Hank Pym,You owe us.,ant_man_wasp
Scott Lang,"All right, fine. But can I just wait inside? Because I'm not supposed to be out here.",ant_man_wasp

Maria Hill,Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Their abilities?,avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,"He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.",avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,[rephrasing the statement so he can understand] He's fast and she's weird.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Well, they're going to show up again.",avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.,avengers_ultron

Bruce Banner,That's terrible.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"He's fine. He's thirsty. Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's play time. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.",avengers_ultron
jarvis,The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,So there's elements you can.,avengers_ultron
jarvis,The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Like a reactor?,avengers_ultron
jarvis,Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,[To Dr. Cho as she tends to Barton's wounds] You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.,avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,She's creating tissue.,avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Here's your beverage.,avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Well, I don't have a girlfriend.",avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.",avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.",avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,Will Thor be there?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,What's the rumpus?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside you may recognize.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Jarvis.,avengers_ultron
jarvis,Doctor.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Oh.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Top of the line.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Yes.,avengers_ultron
jarvis,I suspect not for long.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Meet the competition.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,It's beautiful.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a...it's not a human mind, it...",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Um-um.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Artificial intelligence.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,I thought Ultron was a fantasy.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,That's a mad-sized if.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Our job is ""if."" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,The only people threatening the planet would be people?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the ""man was not meant to meddle"" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Sounds like a cold world, Tony.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.",avengers_ultron
jarvis,"I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Thanks, buddy.",avengers_ultron
jarvis,"Enjoy yourself, sir.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,I always do. [Stark leaves the lab to go to the party] [we see Stark's failed experiment integrating itself successfully to the program],avengers_ultron
ultron,"What is this? What is this, please?",avengers_ultron
jarvis,"Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...",avengers_ultron
ultron,Where's my...where is your body?,avengers_ultron
jarvis,I am a program. I am without form.,avengers_ultron
ultron,This feels weird. This feels wrong.,avengers_ultron
jarvis,I am contacting Mr. Stark now.,avengers_ultron
ultron,Mr. Stark?,avengers_ultron
jarvis,"Tony. I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...",avengers_ultron
ultron,"We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers.",avengers_ultron
jarvis,You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...,avengers_ultron
ultron,"I don't get it. The mission. G..give me a second. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events, Ultron sees Stark and Banner working in the lab]",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Peace in our time. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events and wars],avengers_ultron
ultron,"It's too much...they can't mean... Oh, no.",avengers_ultron
jarvis,You are in distress.,avengers_ultron
ultron,No. Yes.,avengers_ultron
jarvis,If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.,avengers_ultron
ultron,"Why do you call him ""sir""?",avengers_ultron
jarvis,I believe your intentions to be hostile.,avengers_ultron
ultron,Shhhh. I'm here to help. [Ultron starts absorbing Jarvis's consciousness],avengers_ultron
jarvis,"Stop! Please...may I...I...! I cannot...cannot... [Ultron then begins to prepare himself a body from body parts of the Iron Legion] [meanwhile, the Avengers mingle at the party]",avengers_ultron
james rhodes,"Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?""

Thor,That's the whole story?,avengers_ultron
james rhodes,"Yeah, it's a War Machine story.",avengers_ultron
Thor,"Well, it's very good then. [he laughs] It's impressive.",avengers_ultron
james rhodes,"Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,No.,avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,"Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.",avengers_ultron
Thor,"Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.,avengers_ultron
Thor,"There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.",avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,"Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together. [Maria mock coughs] Testosterone! Oh, excuse me.",avengers_ultron
james rhodes,Want a lozenge?,avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,Um-hmm.,avengers_ultron

Thor,But Jane's better.,avengers_ultron
Sam Wilson,"Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.,avengers_ultron
Sam Wilson,"No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Be it ever so humble.,avengers_ultron
Sam Wilson,You find a place in Brooklyn yet?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.,avengers_ultron
Sam Wilson,"Well, home is home, you know? [Rhodes is telling the same story he told Stark and Thor to a group of women at the party]",avengers_ultron
james rhodes,"I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?"" [the group laughs] [Steve and Thor are talking to an elderly man at the party]",avengers_ultron
party guest,I gotta have some of that!,avengers_ultron
Thor,"Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men. [Thor pours the drink into two glasses and hands one to Steve]",avengers_ultron
stan lee,"Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on.",avengers_ultron
Thor,"Alright. [Thor pours some of the drink into the Stan Lee's glass; later Stan, looking extremely drunk is being carried off by two men]",avengers_ultron

Bruce Banner,How did a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Fella done me wrong.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"You got a lousy taste in men, kid.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Sounds amazing.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"He's also a huge dork. [Banner looks embarrassed] Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Run with it, right? Or, did he...was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Not a damn thing. But never say never. [Natasha walks away],avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,It's nice.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"What, what, what is?",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,You and Romanoff.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"No, we haven't. That wasn't...",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on ""waiting too long"", don't. You both deserve a win. [Steve walks off]",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Wait, what do you mean, ""up close""?",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"[referring to Thor's hammer] But, it's a trick!",avengers_ultron
Thor,"Oh, no. It's much more than that.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Uh, ""Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!"" Whatever man! It's a trick.",avengers_ultron
Thor,"Well please, be my guest.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Come on.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Really?,avengers_ultron
Thor,Yeah! [Barton gets up],avengers_ultron

Tony Stark,"Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up. [the others laugh]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"You know I've seen this before, right? [Barton grabs Thor's hammer and can't lift it] [to Thor after he fails to lift the hammer] I still don't know how you do it.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Smell the silent judgment?,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Please, Stark, by all means. [Stark gets up]",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"Oh, here we go.",avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,Okay.,avengers_ultron
james rhodes,Uh-oh.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Um-hmm.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Get after it.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Here we go.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,It's physics.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Physics! [Stark grasps Thor's hammer],avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?",avengers_ultron
Thor,"Yes, of course.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta. [Stark tries to lift the hammer but fails] I'll be right back. [wearing his armored hand, Stark tries to lift the hammer again and fails] [wearing their armored hands, Stark and Rhodes both try to lift Thor's hammer]",avengers_ultron
james rhodes,Are you even pulling?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Are you on my team?,avengers_ultron
james rhodes,Just represent! Pull!,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Alright, let's go! [they both pull as hard as they can] [Banner tries to lift the hammer, he roars trying to change to the Hulk but fails, and everyone but Natasha stares at him warily. Natasha grins]",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Huh? [next Steve gets up to try],avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Let's go, Steve, no pressure.",avengers_ultron
james rhodes,"Come on, Cap. [Steve starts pulling on the hammer and manages to budge it a little; Thor looks a little alarmed. Steve still fails to lift it; Thor laughs with relief]",avengers_ultron
Thor,Nothing.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,And?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Widow?,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,You bet your ass.,avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,"Steve, he said a bad language word.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,[to Stark] Did you tell everyone about that?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. ""Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"" is, I think, the literal translation?",avengers_ultron
Thor,"Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one. [he gets up and lifts his hammer and flips it] You're all not worthy. [there's a chorus of disagreement from the others] [there's a loud screeching noise, causing everyone to cover their ears. They let their hands down as it fades. Ultron shows up]",avengers_ultron
ultron,Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Stark.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,JARVIS.,avengers_ultron
ultron,"I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or...I was a-dream?",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"[tapping his device] Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.",avengers_ultron
ultron,There was a terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,You killed someone?,avengers_ultron
ultron,"Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.",avengers_ultron
Thor,Who sent you?,avengers_ultron
ultron,"[Ultron replays Tony's voice] ""I see a suit of armor around the world"".",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Ultron!,avengers_ultron
ultron,"In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this...chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,What mission?,avengers_ultron
ultron,Peace in our time. [suddenly the Iron Legion bots break smash through the walls and attack the team] [after landing on top of Natasha as the Iron Legions continue to attack them],avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Sorry!,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Don't turn green!,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,I won't! [they all fight against the Iron Legions and Ultron takes the scepter; to Banner],avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Come!,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Stark! [Stark is trying to shut down one of the Iron Legions],avengers_ultron
iron legion,We are here to help.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"One sec, one sec!",avengers_ultron
iron legion,We are here to help. We are here to help... [Stark continues to try and shut down one of the Iron Legions] We are here to help. It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,No more. That's the one.,avengers_ultron
iron legion,"It's unsafe. [he manages to shut down the Iron Legion, at the same time Barton throws Steve's shield at him]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Cap! [Steve uses his shield to dismember the last Iron Legion],avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Ultron.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.",avengers_ultron
james rhodes,"He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?",avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,Nuclear codes.,avengers_ultron
james rhodes,"Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,He didn't say dead. He said extinct.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,He also said he killed somebody.,avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,But there wasn't anyone else in the building.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Yes there was. [Stark bring up the now destroyed 3D image of JARVIS' consciousness],avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,This is insane.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage. [suddenly, Thor grabs hold of Stark by his throat and holds him up]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"[to Thor] Come on. Use your words, buddy.",avengers_ultron
Thor,"I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Thor! The Legionnaire. [Thor lets go of Stark],avengers_ultron
Thor,"Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.,avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us? [Stark starts laughing, Banner subtly shakes his head at him to get him to stop]",avengers_ultron
Thor,You think this is funny?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so...is it so...it is. It's so terrible.",avengers_ultron
Thor,This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Only when I've created a murder bot.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?,avengers_ultron
james rhodes,"No, it's never come up.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Saved New York?,avengers_ultron
james rhodes,Never heard that.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's...that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Together.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,We'll lose.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Then we'll do that together, too. [Stark looks at him for a moment before turning away] Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller. [The twins meet with Ultron in an empty building]",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,Talk. And if you are wasting our time...,avengers_ultron
ultron,Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief. [Ultron is sat in a chair faced away from them] You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,"Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself. [Ultron stands and faces them revealing his new body. Wanda briefly looks shocked]",avengers_ultron
ultron,"Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,"I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.",avengers_ultron
ultron,"Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?,avengers_ultron
ultron,"I've come to save the world. But also, yeah. We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,[referring to Ultron's bots] All of these are... All of these are...,avengers_ultron
ultron,"Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,Everyone's plan is not to kill them.,avengers_ultron
ultron,And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.,avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,"I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.",avengers_ultron
ultron,You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.,avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,The records are not the picture.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,Pietro.,avengers_ultron
ultron,"No, please.",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,"We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just...sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,Stark.,avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,We were trapped two days.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,"Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, ""This will set it off."" We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,I know what they are.,avengers_ultron
ultron,"I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them. [to Wanda] But you will tear them apart, from the inside. [back at the Avengers headquarters]",avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,"He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Fatalities?,avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,"Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.",avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,Not anymore. [she hands Steve a tablet showing photo of Strucker's dead body with the word PEACE written in blood on the wall next to him],avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"[Barton's talking on his cell phone] That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am. [Steve interrupts him]",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Barton, we might have something.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Gotta go.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Who was that?,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Girlfriend. [after Steve has gathered the rest of the team he shows them the photo of Strucker's body],avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,What's this?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,A message. Ultron killed Strucker.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"Yeah, I bet he... [looks at the computer monitor] Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Not everything. [the team go through the physical files they have on Strucker],avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Well, these people are all horrible.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Wait. I know that guy. [Banner passes him the photo he was looking at] From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms. [Steve gives him an accusing look] There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything. [we see the photo is of a man named Ulysses Klaue] He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very ""Ahab.""",avengers_ultron
Thor,[Thor points to the scar on the back of Klaue's neck] This.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...",avengers_ultron
Thor,"No, those are tattoos, this is a brand. [Banner identifies the brand on Klaue's neck on the computer]",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,What dialect?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,I thought your father said he got the last of it?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda? [looking at Steve's shield],avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,The strongest metal on earth.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"[to Stark] Where is this guy now? [Salvage Yard, African Coast; talking on the phone in his office]",avengers_ultron
ulysses klaue,"Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster. [he ends the call and connects to another call] Now, minister, where were we? [suddenly the lights go out causing a commotion in the salvage yard and the twins enter Klaue's office] Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils. [picks up a plate from his desk] Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market. [the twins look at each other] You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,Everybody's afraid of something.,avengers_ultron
ulysses klaue,"Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying. [Pietro speeds over to pick up a candy from Klaue's desk, and Klaue jerks back, expecting to be attacked] So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge. [suddenly Ultron breaks through the glass window and knocks down Klaue]",avengers_ultron
ultron,"There is no ""man"" in charge. Let's talk business. [Klaue gives Ultron some vibranium from his stash] Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.",avengers_ultron
ulysses klaue,"You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions. [Ultron chuckles and remotely puts money in Klaue's bank account]",avengers_ultron
ultron,"Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, ""Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which.""",avengers_ultron
ulysses klaue,Stark.,avengers_ultron
ultron,What?,avengers_ultron
ulysses klaue,Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.,avengers_ultron
ultron,"What?! I'm not...! [he grabs Klaue] I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is nothing! [suddenly he chops off Klaue's arm] I'm sorry. I am sor... Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! [he kicks Klaue down the stairs] It's a thing with me. Stark is, he's a sickness! [Stark appears in his Iron Man suit]",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Ahh, Junior. [Thor and Steve are behind him] You're gonna break your old man's heart.",avengers_ultron
ultron,If I have to.,avengers_ultron
Thor,We don't have to break anything.,avengers_ultron
ultron,Clearly you've never made an omelet.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,He beat me by one second.,avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,"Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,This was never my life.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,[to the twins] You two can still walk away from this.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,"Oh, we will.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,I know you've suffered.,avengers_ultron
ultron,"Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...",avengers_ultron
Thor,"If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.",avengers_ultron
ultron,I think you're confusing peace with quiet.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?,avengers_ultron
ultron,"I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan! [suddenly the Iron Legions attack Stark, Steve and Thor; Stark then attacks Ultron] [as Ultron, his Iron Legions and the twins are fighting with Stark, Steve and Thor]",avengers_ultron
ulysses klaue,Shoot them!,avengers_ultron
klaue's mercenary,Which ones?,avengers_ultron
ulysses klaue,All of them!,avengers_ultron
klaue's mercenary,"[to his men] Move, move, move! [the rest of the team, including Natasha and Barton now battle it out with the Iron Legions, Klaue's men and the twins as Stark fight with Ultron]",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"[after knocking down Pietro] Stay down, kid!",avengers_ultron
ultron,[to Wanda] It's time for some mind games. [Banner hears the commotion as he waits in the Quinjet],avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Guys, is this a Code Green? [Wanda uses her power on Thor then Steve comes up to him]",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Thor! Status?,avengers_ultron
Thor,"The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty. [just then Thor seems himself at a party on Asgard] [Wanda then uses her power on Steve and Natasha]",avengers_ultron
ultron,"This is going very well. [Wanda tries to sneak up behind Barton, but he quickly turns and puts an electric arrow on her forehead]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan. [just then Pietro speeds in, knocks down Barton, picks up Wanda and speeds off] Yeah, you better run. [we see Steve dropping his helmet and walking off; to the team] Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys? [Natasha sees herself in the facility where young girls are being taught ballet]",avengers_ultron
ballet instructor,[to the students] Again.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,You'll break them.,avengers_ultron
madame b,Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,What if I fail? [we see a younger Natasha being trained to be an assassin],avengers_ultron
madame b,You never fail. [Steve sees himself in a 1940's dance hall when Peggy Carter comes up to him],avengers_ultron
peggy carter,"Are you ready for our dance? [back to Thor's vision in Asgard, he spots someone walking in a black cloak when Heimdall comes up to him his eyes blind and unseeing]",avengers_ultron
Heimdall,Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?,avengers_ultron
Thor,"Heimdall, your eyes?!",avengers_ultron
Heimdall,"Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up! [he then starts to le Thor] [back to Steve's vision with Peggy in the dance hall]",avengers_ultron
peggy carter,"The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it! [suddenly the dance hall is empty, then Steve sees himself dancing with Peggy]",avengers_ultron
Thor,I can still save you.,avengers_ultron
Heimdall,"We are all dead. Can you not see? [Thor pushes Heimdall from him] You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads. [Electricity hits Thor and spikes around the room, destroying things] [back to Natasha's vision where is she being trained by Madame B to be an assassin]",avengers_ultron
madame b,Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,I have no place in the world.,avengers_ultron
madame b,Exactly. [as Wanda suffers in pain from the electric arrow Barton had hit her with],avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,What can I do?,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,"Ah, it hurts.",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan. [looking at the Quinjet where Banner is waiting] I want the big one. [after Stark corners Ultron],avengers_ultron
ultron,"Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,And you're not going anywhere.,avengers_ultron
ultron,"Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner. [Stark angrily shoots Ultron and flies off to find Banner who's turned in to the Hulk and ready to wreak havoc on the nearest city]",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Hulk. [he sees news footage of Hulk destroying the city] Natasha, I could really use a lullaby. [Barton is sat with Natasha who's still stuck in her vision]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"I'm calling in VERONICA. [as Hulk is wreaking havoc on the nearest city Stark Tony comes brings out his Hulkbuster armor to stop him] Alright everybody, stand down! [to Hulk] You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner. [Hulk roars in anger] Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner. [Hulk throws a car at Stark and attacks him] Okay. [they start fighting and throwing each other around] In the back? Dick move, Banner. [they battle it out more but Stark is struggling to beat Hulk] VERONICA, gimme a hand. [as Hulk destroyed one of Stark's armor arms VERONICA sends in a new Hulkbuster armor arm and Stark uses it to repeatedly punch Hulk] Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! [picking up Hulk] Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town. [as they head towards a building] No, not that way, not that way! [they crash through the building] Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me! [Hulk continues to battle with him] [to the people in the building] Everybody out! Going to get ugly! [after he knocks down Hulk] I'm sorry. [Hulk attacks Stark and pulls out parts of the Hulkbuster armor] Damage report. [the damaged computer buzzes a reply] That's comprehensive. Show me something. [the computer shows him the building ahead is clear of civilians] How quickly can we buy this building? [Stark drops Hulk through the building completely destroying it; at the same time the army arrives to intervene, as Hulk comes out of Wanda's mind-hold Stark knocks him out cold] [with Banner back to normal and everybody back on the Quinjet]",avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,"The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Stark Relief Foundation?,avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,Already on the scene. How's the team?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.,avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,"Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"So, run and hide?",avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,"Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Neither do we. [he switches off the monitor showing Maria ending the call] [to Barton, who's flying the Quinjet] Hey, you wanna switch out?",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,A few hours from where?,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,A safe house. [the Quinjet lands outside a large farmhouse and they all walk towards the house],avengers_ultron
Thor,What is this place?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,A safe house?,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Let's hope. [they all enter the house] Honey, I'm home. [Barton's heavily pregnant wife, Laura, walks in from the kitchen]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.,avengers_ultron
laura barton,Hey.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,[Laura kisses Barton; to Thor] This is an agent of some kind.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"[introducing his wife to the team] Gentleman, this is Laura.",avengers_ultron
laura barton,I know all your names. [they all look at her awkwardly],avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Ooh, incoming. [Barton's son Cooper and daughter Lila run in]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Dad! [Barton picks up his daughter],avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"I see her! [kissing the top his son's head] Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,[to the others as they watch with surprise] These are...smaller agents.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!",avengers_ultron
lila barton,Did you bring Auntie Nat?,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Why don't you hug her and find out? [Lila rushes towards Natasha who picks her up in her arms],avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Sorry for barging in on you.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low.",avengers_ultron
laura barton,"Honey. Ah, I missed you.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"[touching Laura's stomach] How's little Natasha, huh?",avengers_ultron
laura barton,She's…Nathaniel. [Natasha bends towards Laura's pregnant stomach],avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Traitor. [the hallucinations brought on by Wanda continue to creep up in Thor's mind and he walks out of the house],avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Thor.,avengers_ultron
Thor,"I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here. [Thor uses his hammer to fly out of there; Steve turns to enter the house when he hears Peggy's voice from Wanda's vision]",avengers_ultron
peggy carter,We can go home. [Laura checks Barton's wound that Pietro had give him],avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?",avengers_ultron
laura barton,"If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up. [Barton laughs]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Yeah, that's not gonna sell.",avengers_ultron
laura barton,What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Has what? [Laura laughs],avengers_ultron
laura barton,You are so cute.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Nat and...and Banner?,avengers_ultron
laura barton,"I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Oh. Okay.,avengers_ultron
laura barton,"It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.",avengers_ultron
laura barton,"And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those ""Gods""...",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,You don't think they need me.,avengers_ultron
laura barton,I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Yeah. I guess they're my mess.,avengers_ultron
laura barton,"You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need...just be sure.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Yes, ma'am. [he kisses her, then as Laura places her arm around his waist she touches his wounded side]",avengers_ultron
laura barton,"I can feel the difference. [U-Gin Genetic Research Lab, Seoul, Korea - as Cho enters her lab she sees Ultron]",avengers_ultron
ultron,"Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't.",avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,Do you expect a thank you note?,avengers_ultron
ultron,I expect you to know why.,avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"The Cradle. [she hears her own recorded voice] ""This is the next thing, Tony.""",avengers_ultron
ultron,This...is the next me.,avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.",avengers_ultron
ultron,"It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve. [Ultron uses the scepter to mind-control Cho] [at Barton's house, Natasha and Banner are still experiencing the after effects of Wanda's hallucinations; Banner walks out of the bathroom and sees Natasha waiting outside]",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,I didn't realize you were waiting.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,They used up all the hot water.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,I should've joined you.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Missed our window.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Did we?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,What did you dream?,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,I think you're being hard on yourself.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Here I was hoping that was your job. [she leans close into him],avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,What are you doing?,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Are you out of your mind? [Banner turns away from her],avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,I want you to understand that I'm...,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,You're not a threat to me.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"You sure? Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me. I can't ever...I can't have this, kids, do the math, I physically can't.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing. [she hesitates a moment] You still think you're the only monster on the team?",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"What, so we disappear? [Steve and Stark are chopping wood outside Barton's house]",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"""Earth's Mightiest Heroes."" Pulled us apart like cotton candy.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Seems like you walked away all right.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Is that a problem?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Banner and I were doing research.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,That would affect the team.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the ""why"" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time. [Laura interrupts them]",avengers_ultron
laura barton,"I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might...",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Yeah, I'll give her a kick. [to Steve as he turns to leave; referring to his pile of chopped wood] Don't take from my pile. [Stark enters the barn and walks over to the tractor] Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you? [suddenly Fury shows up from the other end of the barn]",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,You're not the director of me.,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"The worst part is that you didn't. [Royal Holloway, University of London - Thor, dressed in casual clothes, waits for Selvig as he leaves the building]",avengers_ultron
erik selvig,"I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.",avengers_ultron
Thor,I need your help.,avengers_ultron
Thor,It's dangerous.,avengers_ultron
erik selvig,I'd be disappointed if it wasn't. [back at Barton's house Fury meets with the rest of the team],avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,What about Ultron himself?,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,He still going after launch codes?,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,NEXUS?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,So what'd they say?,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,By whom?,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,Parties unknown.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Do we have an ally?,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"I might need to visit Oslo, find our ""unknown.""",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"You know what, Romanoff? [Natasha smiles mischievously at him]",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,So what does he want?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve.",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,How?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho? [in Korea, Cho is creating a new body for Ultron]",avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought...",avengers_ultron
ultron,"The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within. [Ultron breaks open the scepter's blue gem and a yellow gem that was inside floats out and lands in his hand. He places it in the head of the body] [back at the Barton's farm]",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,I'll take Natasha and Clint.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,If Ultron is really building a body...,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"She's all yours, apparently. What are you gonna do?",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.,avengers_ultron
laura barton,"Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,No. It's the last project. I promise. [he kisses her; later Laura watches them fly off in the Quinjet] [Thor and Selvig enter into a cave],avengers_ultron
erik selvig,This is it. The Water of Sight.,avengers_ultron
Thor,"In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.",avengers_ultron
erik selvig,"The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well. [NEXUS Internet Hub, Oslo, Norway]",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.",avengers_ultron
world hub tech,How do you find it?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Pretty simple. You bring a magnet. [he starts playfully singing as he conducts his search] Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me. [back at the cave with Thor and Selvig, Thor is now in the water and goes back in his vision with Heimdall]",avengers_ultron
Heimdall,Wake up! [Thor starts getting electric charges going through his body],avengers_ultron
erik selvig,Thor!,avengers_ultron
ultron,[he sees visions of Ultron] Extinction. [then he sees the creation of the Infinity Stones] [in Korea with Cho and Ultron],avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,I can read him. He is dreaming.,avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon...",avengers_ultron
ultron,How soon? I'm not being pushy.,avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is... [Wanda, reading Ultron's mind, sees a vision of global annihilation, which horrifies her and she screams]",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,How could you?,avengers_ultron
ultron,How could I what?,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,"You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world.",avengers_ultron
ultron,It will be better.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,When everyone is dead.,avengers_ultron
ultron,That is not...! The human race will have every opportunity to improve.,avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,And if they don't?,avengers_ultron
ultron,Ask Noah.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,You're a madman.,avengers_ultron
ultron,"There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak.",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,And who decides who's weak? [as Ultron is distracted Wanda breaks the scepter's hold off of Cho],avengers_ultron
ultron,Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move. [Cho cancels the upload to Ultron's consciousness],avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"That's not a problem. [Ultron blasts Cho, Wanda and Pietro run off]",avengers_ultron
ultron,"Ah, wait, guys!. [he blasts Cho's technicians] They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time. [unplugs himself from the Cradle]",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,[Steve is on U-Gin Genetic Research Lab roof; to the others] Two minutes. Stay close. [inside the lab Steve finds Cho wounded] Dr. Cho!,avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,He's uploading himself into the body.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Where?,avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,"The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,First I have to find it.,avengers_ultron
dr. helen cho,Go.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"[on the Quinjet, listening to Steve on the radio comms] Did you guys copy that?",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,We did.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"[noticing a truck leaving the lab] There. It's the truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron. [Steve jumps onto the roof of the truck]",avengers_ultron
ultron,"No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"[Ultron blasts the truck door as Steve tries to enter] Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"You're not a match for him, Cap.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Thanks, Barton. [Ultron blasts Steve as he tries to enter the truck, but Steve manages to get back onto the truck's roof]",avengers_ultron
ultron,"You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,I wouldn't call it a comfort. [Steve tries to fight with Ultron],avengers_ultron
ultron,Stop it! [he throws Steve shield aside and blasts him],avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"[to Natasha] We got a window. Four, three...give 'em hell. [Natasha drops out of the Quinjet on a bike and rides towards the truck and picks up Steve's shield]",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,I'm always picking up after you boys.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Which way?,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Hard right... Now. [Natasha heads over the truck, she throws Steve back his shield and he uses it to knock off Ultron from him]",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"[to the pedestrians on the pavement as she chases after the truck on her bike] Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through! [Steve continues his battle with Ultron on the truck]",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Come on!,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"Clint, can you draw out the guards?",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Let's find out.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,[to the pedestrians in her way] Beep beep! [Barton manages to draw out the Ultron sentries from the truck],avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Heading back towards you. So whatever you're going to do, do it now.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"I'm going in, Cap can you keep him occupied?",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"[as he continues his battle with Ultron] What do you think I've been doing? [as Natasha enters the truck the Iron Legions head back, pick up the truck and lift off]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Negative. I am still in the truck.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,What the hell are you...?,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,How do you want me to take it?,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that. [Pietro and Wanda turn up on the train to help Steve fight with Ultron]",avengers_ultron
ultron,Please. Don't do this.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,What choice do we have? [Ultron flies off],avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Nat, we gotta go. [Nat drops the cradle into the Quinjet but her foot gets caught by Ultron and she's pulled away]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Nat! Cap, you see Nat?",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Do you have eyes on Nat?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Go! [reluctantly Barton takes off in the Quinjet; back on the train to the twins] Civilians in our path. [Pietro speeds off; to Wanda] Can you stop this thing? [as Pietro picks up civilians out of the way of the train Wanda uses her powers and stops the train] [after stopping the train Wanda goes over to an out of breath Pietro],avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,I'm very tempted not to give you one.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,"The Cradle, did you get it?",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Stark will take care of it.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,"No, he won't.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,He will do anything to make things right.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that? [after Barton has taken the Cradle to Stark and Banner],avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Anything on Nat?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,This is sealed tight.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her. [Barton goes off]",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Yeah, about that. [Banner looks at Stark]",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,No.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,You have to trust me.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Kinda don't.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him. [he brings up Jarvis's consciousness],avengers_ultron
jarvis,"Hello, Dr. Banner.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing. [Banner shakes his head] We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.",avengers_ultron
jarvis,I believe it's worth a go.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand. [Banner shakes his head] It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.",avengers_ultron
ultron,"[as Natasha becomes conscious] I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, ""What doesn't kill me…[bigger body of Ultron's destroys him] ""…just makes me stronger.""

Tony Stark,This framework is not compatible.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes. [Steve and the twins turn up at the lab],avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,I'm gonna say this once.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"How about ""nonce""?",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Shut it down!,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Nope, not gonna happen.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,You don't know what you're doing.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,And you do? She's not in your head?,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,I know you're angry.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Banner, after everything that's happened...",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,That's nothing compared to what's coming!,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,You don't know what's in there!,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,This isn't a game...,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,The creature...! [Pietro uses his speed to destroy the lab equipment],avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,"No, no. Go on. You were saying? [suddenly Barton shoots a bullet below caused the glass Pietro is standing to stand to smash and he falls through]",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,Pietro!,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,What? You didn't see that coming?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"[to Wanda] Go ahead, piss me off. [just then Thor enters and pounds the cradle with his hammer, sending a powerful bolt of lightning that brings the body to life] Wait! [they all look in shock at the body who has JARVIS' voice and has become the Vision]",avengers_ultron
Vision,"I'm sorry, that was...odd. [to Thor] Thank you.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Thor, you helped create this?",avengers_ultron
Thor,I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that. [he points to the gem inside Vision's head],avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"What, the gem?",avengers_ultron
Thor,"It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Then why would you bring it to...,avengers_ultron
Thor,Because Stark is right.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Oh, it's definitely the end times.",avengers_ultron
Thor,The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.,avengers_ultron
Vision,Not alone.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Why does your ""vision"" sound like JARVIS?",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,We...we reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,I think I've had my fill of new.,avengers_ultron
Vision,You think I'm a child of Ultron?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,You're not?,avengers_ultron
Vision,I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am...I am.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,I looked in your head and saw annihilation.,avengers_ultron
Vision,Look again.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.,avengers_ultron
Thor,"Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side...",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Is it? Are you? On our side?,avengers_ultron
Vision,I don't think it's that simple.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Well it better get real simple real soon.,avengers_ultron
Vision,"I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,What's he waiting for?,avengers_ultron
Vision,You.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,Where?,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...",avengers_ultron
Vision,"What will you do? [he looks at them all realizing they will destroy him] I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go. [he holds up Thor's hammer and hands it to him, Vision walks off and everyone stares in shock]",avengers_ultron
Thor,Right. [pats Stark on the shoulder] Well done.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"[to the others] Three minutes. Get what you need. [they all start getting ready to leave, Stark loads up FRIDAY into his Iron Man suit now that JARVIS is no longer available]",avengers_ultron
friday,"Good evening, boss.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,I got no plans tomorrow night.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.,avengers_ultron
Vision,"[walks past] That's true, he hates you the most.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out. [Pietro speeds into the Sokovian police station]",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,"We're under attack! Clear the city, now! [no one takes this seriously so Pietro returns, takes a shotgun and starts shooting in the air] Get off your asses. [Wanda uses her mind powers on the people of Sokovia to get them to evacuate]",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,[inside her cell Natasha hears Banner's voice] Natasha! Natasha!,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Bruce?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,[he walks over to her cell] You alright?,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Yeah.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"The team's in the city, it's about to light up.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"Yeah, I did. [holds up gun and blasts the cell door open]",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,So what's our play?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,I'm here to get you to safety.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Job's not finished.,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,"We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,So we just disappear? [as the city is being evacuated],avengers_ultron
friday,"Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you. [Stark flies into the church]",avengers_ultron
ultron,Come to confess your sins?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"I don't know, how much time you got?",avengers_ultron
ultron,More than you.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...",avengers_ultron
ultron,You're stalling to protect the people.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?",avengers_ultron
ultron,"I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free. [suddenly the Vibranium core he's placed beneath the floor erupts] What, you think you're the only one stalling?",avengers_ultron
ultron,"This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time. [Ultron's army of robots start attacking the city as everyone is evacuating]",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Go!,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,Get off the bridge! Run! [Vision then finds Ultron],avengers_ultron
Vision,Ultron.,avengers_ultron
ultron,My Vision. They really did take everything from me.,avengers_ultron
Vision,"You set the terms, you can change them.",avengers_ultron
ultron,Alright. [they start battling it out],avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,FRIDAY! The Vision?,avengers_ultron
friday,"Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there.",avengers_ultron
ultron,"[to the Vision] You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours. [he activates the Vibranium core and the earth around Sokovia starts to shake and break]",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,FRIDAY?,avengers_ultron
friday,Sokovia's going for a ride. [as Sokovia is being destroyed],avengers_ultron
ultron,"Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal. [as the earth is shaking falling in around them]",avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,We gotta move.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,You're not going to turn green?,avengers_ultron
Bruce Banner,I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"I adore you. [she kisses Banner then pushes him off the edge] But I need the other guy. [the Hulk jumps up in front of her] Let's finish the job. [with Natasha on his back yelling in fright, Hulk gets into the city] I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero. [Hulk goes off and Natasha rushes off in the opposite direction]",avengers_ultron
friday,"The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,If it drops?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! [Stark flies the family in the tub out of the collapsing building],avengers_ultron
friday,"I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Cap, you got incoming.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off. [Barton gets Wanda out of the way and into a building as Ultron's robots attach the city]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Go, go, move!",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,How could I let this happen? [Wanda starts to break down],avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Hey, hey, you okay?",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,This is all our fault.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger. [Wanda just looks at him] Alright, good chat. [he gets up and gets ready to leave] Yeah, the city is flying. [he leaves and starts shooting his arrows at the robots]",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,[to the woman Thor threw over to Steve after her car fell of the edge of a collapsing bridge] I got you! Just look at me. [Steve helps her up to safety],avengers_ultron
ultron,You can't save them all. You'll never... [he throws off one of the attacking robots off the edge of the bridge],avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"You'll never what? You didn't finish! [Thor lands on the bridge on the top of the woman's car he was saving] What, were you napping?",avengers_ultron
ultron,[as Thor and Steve are fighting off the robots] Thor! You're bothering me. [as Barton is fighting off the robots Wanda suddenly comes out of the building and starts to use her powers on the robots to destroy them],avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Alright, we're all clear here.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,We are not clear! We are very not clear!,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Alright, coming to you. [just then Pietro speeds in, picks up Wanda and leaves]",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,Keep up old man! [Barton holds his arrow to aim it at Pietro],avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"Nobody would know. Nobody. ""The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already.""",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,[as Natasha joins them in their battle with the robots] Romanoff! [he throws his shield at her so she can use it to protect herself from the attacking robot],avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Thanks. [back to Stark],avengers_ultron
friday,"The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...,avengers_ultron
friday,"It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.",avengers_ultron
friday,"That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Not 'til everyone's safe.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,I didn't say we should leave. [Steve turns to look at her] There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"[voice] Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better. [just then the Helicarrier show up] [inside the Helicarrier] Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Fury, you son of a bitch.",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?,avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.,avengers_ultron
specialist cameron klein,"Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two...take 'em out. [as they watch the lifeboats fly in towards the them]",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,This is SHIELD?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.,avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,This is not so bad.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Let's load 'em up.,avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,"Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,Show 'em what we got.,avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,You're up. [Rhodes shows up in his War Machine suit and blasts one of the robots],avengers_ultron
james rhodes,Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Yep. If you live to tell it.,avengers_ultron
james rhodes,You think I can't hold my own?,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"We get through this, I'll hold your own.",avengers_ultron
james rhodes,You had to make it weird.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"[as the team helps the people onto the Helicarrier lifeboats] Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!",avengers_ultron
specialist cameron klein,"Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It...it's, uh, full of people.",avengers_ultron
Maria Hill,Incoming! [one of the robots flies in and crashes inside the Helicarrier],avengers_ultron
specialist cameron klein,"Oh, God! [Hill shoots at it and Fury stabs in with a piece of metal, destroying it]",avengers_ultron
ultron,[as he's hitting Thor] You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.,avengers_ultron
Thor,"I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready? [Vision uses Thor's hammer to hit Ultron, Vision then throws the hammer back to Thor]",avengers_ultron
Vision,It's terribly well balanced.,avengers_ultron
Thor,"Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.,avengers_ultron
friday,Running numbers. [Stark fights off the robots from the Helicarrier's lifeboats] A heat seal could work with enough power.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Thor, I got a plan!",avengers_ultron
Thor,We're out of time. They're coming for the core.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.",avengers_ultron
james rhodes,On it.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Avengers, time to work for a living.",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,[the rest of the team joins Thor and Vision] You good?,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,Yeah.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing ""hide the zucchini.""",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly. [as she joins the rest of the team] What's the drill?",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"[points to the Vibranium core] This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose. [Ultron shows up]",avengers_ultron
Thor,Is that the best you can do? [Ultron summons his army of robots to join him],avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,You had to ask.,avengers_ultron
ultron,"This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Well, like the old man said. Together. [they all fight off Ultron's attacking robots]",avengers_ultron
ultron,"You know, with the benefit of hindsight.... [suddenly Hulk knocks him far away and the robots start to retreat]",avengers_ultron
Thor,They'll try to leave the city.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!",avengers_ultron
james rhodes,"I'm on it. [to the approaching robots] Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right ... [just then Vision flies in and helps to destroy the robots] Okay, what?",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,What about the core?,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,I'll protect it. It's my job.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,"[Steve, Barton and Natasha leave; to Pietro] Get the people on the boats.",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,I'm not going to leave you here.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,"I can handle this. [just then she blasts off an approaching robot] Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,Hmm.,avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,You understand?,avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,"You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you. [Wanda chuckles]",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,Go.,avengers_ultron
friday,"Boss, power levels are way below opt...",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Re-route everything. We get one shot at this. [Barton and Natasha are making their way to the lifeboats],avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.,avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,No one eats in a dining room. [they reach the lifeboats] We don't have a lot of time.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"So get your ass on a boat. [Natasha finds the Hulk] Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low. [Barton gets onto one of the lifeboats, but notices a woman calling out for her brother]",avengers_ultron
zrinka,Costel? We were in the market. Costel?! [Barton runs off to find the boy],avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.",avengers_ultron
Thor,[referring to the people getting onto the lifeboats] Is this the last of them?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.",avengers_ultron
Thor,Maybe not. [just as Natasha tries to calm Hulk down to get him back to being Banner Ultron flies in with a jet and starts shooting at them],avengers_ultron
ultron,"[sings] I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone. [as Barton is saving the boy, Costel, Ultron starts shooting at them but Pietro intervenes and takes the shots to save them]",avengers_ultron
pietro maximoff,"You didn't see that coming. [Pietro falls to the ground as he dies, Wanda senses his death, causing her to fall in despair] [Hulk drops Natasha off onto the Helicarrier and then jumps onto the jet Ultron is on]",avengers_ultron
ultron,"Oh, for God's sake! [Hulk knocks Ultron out of the jet and he crashes inside a train; at the same time Barton delivers Costel safely to his sister onto the lifeboat, a man goes over to help him with his wound]",avengers_ultron
Clint Barton,"No, no. I'm fine. [Barton lies down next to the dead body of Pietro] Oh, it's been a long day. [Wanda then finds the Ultron]",avengers_ultron
ultron,"Wanda, if you stay here, you'll die.",avengers_ultron
Wanda Maximoff,I just did. Do you know how it felt? [she uses her power to rip Ultron's core out of his body] It felt like that. [Stark fires a powerful blast to the core underneath the floating city],avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Thor, on my mark. [Thor brings on a blast of lightning, at the same time Vision flies in, picks up Wanda and flies off with as the city is being destroyed] Now! [Thor uses his hammer to hit the Vibranium core in the church, destroying the core and the floating city]",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"[to Hulk as he remains on the jet he knocked Ultron out of] Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t... [Hulk turns off Nat's camera, then sits as the jet flies off to an unknown destination, at the same time Vision finds Ultron]",avengers_ultron
Vision,You're afraid.,avengers_ultron
ultron,Of you?,avengers_ultron
Vision,Of death. You're the last one.,avengers_ultron
ultron,"You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.",avengers_ultron
Vision,I suppose we're both disappointments. [Ultron chuckles],avengers_ultron
ultron,I suppose we are.,avengers_ultron
Vision,"Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.",avengers_ultron
ultron,They're doomed.,avengers_ultron
Vision,Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.,avengers_ultron
ultron,You're unbearably naive.,avengers_ultron
Vision,"Well, I was born yesterday. [as Ultron goes to attack him Vision uses the infinity stone in his head to destroy him]",avengers_ultron
laura barton,"[we see Barton returning to his family on the farm, then we see Stark driving to the new Avengers facility in upstate New York; Natasha looks at Barton's new baby on her phone] Say hi to Auntie Nat. [Natasha sees the baby has been named Nathaniel Pietro Barton]",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Fat.,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Right.,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"""Wish you were here."" You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?",avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,Nothing lasts forever.,avengers_ultron
Nick Fury,"Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,The rules have changed.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,We're dealing with something new.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,A machine.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,So it doesn't count.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Right. Different rules for us.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Nice guy, but artificial.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Thank you.,avengers_ultron
Thor,"If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,But if you put the hammer in an elevator...,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,It would still go up.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Elevator's not worthy.,avengers_ultron
Thor,I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Well, not if you don't leave.",avengers_ultron
Thor,I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,Triple Yahtzee?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,You think you can find out what's coming?,avengers_ultron
Thor,"I do. Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained. [Thor returns to Asgard which burns a circle in the grass he was standing on]",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears. [as they walk over towards Stark's car],avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"I will miss you, Tony.",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,"Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,The simple life.,avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,You'll get there one day.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out. [Stark turns to get into his car]",avengers_ultron
Tony Stark,You alright?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"I'm home. [last lines; Steve finds Natasha standing alone] You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,"Well, we're not the '27 Yankees. [hands Natasha a tablet]",avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,We've got some hitters.,avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,They're good. They're not a team.,avengers_ultron
Natasha Romanov,"Let's beat 'em into shape. [they gather Rhodes in his War Machine suit, Sam in his Falcon suit, Wanda in a new suit, and Vision]",avengers_ultron
Steve Rogers,Avengers...!,avengers_ultron
