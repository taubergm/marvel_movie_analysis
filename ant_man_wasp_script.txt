Avengers: Infinity War	Captain Marvel
Hank: [voiceover] I still think about the night your mother and I had to leave you...

[The camera cuts to a young Hope van Dyne, who is walking out of her bedroom into the hallway. There, Janet van Dyne and Hank Pym are talking to a woman.]

Janet: [to the woman, faintly] Hopefully, it's not for long, but I'll call you when we get settled.When I have a better indication of what's going on.

Young Hope: Mommy?

[Janet and Hank turn around to face their daughter. Janet sighs as Hank gets the bags situated.]

Janet: Oh, Jellybean. [She kneels down to meet eye-level with Hope.] Daddy and I have a last minute business trip, so Rose is going to stay with you for a few days.

Young Hope: No. I don't want you to go.

Janet: Ugh! It's gonna be so boring! I won't be able to keep my... eyes...

[Janet then pretends to have dozed off. Hope giggles as Janet snores. Hank walks up to his daughter.

Hank: Goodbye, sweetheart. Alright, we'll see you soon. [He kisses Hope on the forehead. He then touches Janet's shoulder.]

[Janet snorts "awake." Both girls giggle.] 

Hank: [voiceover] I wish we could have put down our bags, and tucked you back into your bed, but too many lives were at stake. 

[Cut to a shrunken Janet and Hank flying onto a metal surface, leaves flying through the air.]

Hank: Oh my god! They've already launched!

[A missile flies up from the surface.]

Janet: We have to stop it! Come on!

[Hank grapples himself up on the bomb while Janet flies. As the missile rockets through the air, Hank and Janet hang onto the steel, desperately trying to disarm the missile.]

Hank: [voiceover] The only way to disarm the missile was to get inside it, but the plating was too thick. The only way in was to shrink between the molecules. 

[Janet flies up beside Hank, putting a grapple line onto her waist.]

Janet: I can't get through! Hank...

[A landmass comes to view through the clouds, meaning the missile could wipe out that place any second.]

Hank: [voiceover] We both knew that if you go that small, there's no coming back. 

[Hank tries to turn a button on his belt, but it sparks and fails. Janet watches.]

Hank: [voiceover] It should have been me, but my regulator was damaged. Your mother's wasn't.

[Janet flies up into the air and turns a button on her belt, making the red light flash.] 

Janet: Tell Hope I love her...

Hank: [voiceover] She turned it off.

Hank: Janet, no!  

[Janet flies into the missile, and shrinks until she cannot be seen. She flies through various systems, disarming the machine and making sparks fly everywhere.]

Hank: [voiceover} And went subatomic to deactivate the bomb. 

[The rocket tumbles and splashes into the ocean.]

Hank: [voiceover] Your mother saves thousands of lives that day, knowing she'd be lost in the quantum realm. Alone. Afraid. Gone forever.

[Young Hope looks back at the doorway and disrupts her playing to greet her father at the door, who looks tired and traumatized. Hope's lip quivers, and Hank pulls her in for an embrace.]

Hank: [voiceover] Telling you that she wasn't coming home, was the hardest thing that I ever had to do.

[Cut to present day, with a grown Hope and an older Hank.] But then Scott showed up...or should I say, broke into our house. And when he went to the Quantum Realm... he came back, everything changed. I started to wonder...could your mother still be alive? [Hank stands up, and Hope follows.] So I dusted off some old plans.

[Hank pulls a rubber band off a rolled up white piece of paper and unfolds it on the huge table. The plans are a blueprint for a "quantum tunnel."]

Hope: Dad, what are you saying?

Hank: I think it's possible to bring her back.

[Present Day]

Scott: Okay. We're in. [A flashlight clicks and turns on, illuminating Scott's face. He shines the light around.] Aw, this place is a maze. Where's that map? ['Scott grabs the map and shines the flashlight on it] We're definitely close. [Scott lowers the map to reveal his ten year old daughter, Cassie, is with him.] Are you ready?

Cassie: I'm ready, Daddy.

Scott: Are you sure? Cause once we're inside, you show any hesitation or fear, we're done.

Cassie: I eat fear for breakfast.

Scott: Wow. That is super cool. Come on.

[Scott and Cassie crawl through the cardboard maze; a fake ant face shows up]

Scott: Look! It's Anton. He'll show us the way. Anton, which way do we go? [There's silence. Scott sighs.] (louder) Anton, which way do we go?!

[Startled, Luis quickly gets up and runs toward the cardboard maze; he grabs two strings and pulls, making the ant's limbs point right.]

Scott: Thanks Anton!

[Luis runs back to his computer; Scott and Cassie continue through the maze]

Scott Lang: Look! The ants have burrowed into the tech facility.

Cassie Lang: Oh, no! Lasers!

[Pieces of red string appear with a red glow, making them look like real lasers. Cassie wiggles through the "lasers" with ease; Scott gets tangled by one]

Scott Lang: Oh! I think I got lased!

[The duo make their way through the lasers; A green, glowing "eye scanner" appears]

Scott Lang: The secret vault. Tell me you brought the contact lens.

Cassie Lang: Yup! 

[Cassie puts a huge paper plate with an eye drawn on it over her face.]

Scott Lang: Perfect! Right there.

[Scott pulls a lever; the glowing disc dings. Cassie takes the lens off her face; the cardboard doors open]

Cassie Lang: There! It's the microtreasure!

[A small trophy is on a plate.]

Scott Lang: My trophy?

Cassie Lang: It looks like treasure.

Scott Lang: Oh, it is to me.

Cassie Lang: I wanna take it to show and tell.

Scott Lang: Oh, you can't do that. Can't. It never leaves the house. It's too important. This is the best birthday present you ever got me. I'm so touched you think I'm the 'World's Greatest Grandma.'"

[The camera cuts to the trophy plaque, which indeed says 'World's Greatest Grandma.']

Cassie: (giggles) It was the only one they had.

Scott: Makes me wanna knit you a sweater. 

[Luis lifts up the sheet covering the maze, laptop in hand, so he can face Scott.]

Cassie: Oh no! The fuzz! 

Luis: Hey, Scotty. I was looking at the schematics for the Karapetyan buildings, and I think we have way too many security cameras, don't we?

Scott: No, no, not at all.

Luis: You sure? 'Cause it's a lot of security cameras. 

Scott: I know what he needs. Who's the security expert in our business? 

Luis: You are, but I'm running the company, and if we oversell it, he's gonna go somewhere else. I mean, we gotta land this bird. 

Scott: He ain't goin' anywhere. And the expression is "'land this fish."

Luis: No. It's "land the bird." Just like you land a plane. You gotta land the plane to be in business. 

Scott: I know it's silly to get hung up on these kinds of things, but I do.

Luis: How am I gonna land a fish? It can't walk. And if it swam up on a shore, and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?

Scott: You really turned me around on this thing. It's okay. We're gonna land Karapetyan. Now, if you just excuse me, I'm in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter. 

Luis: Imma go recheck it.

[Scott pulls a string, making an alarm clock ring.]

Cassie: To the escape ant. 

[A cardboard door lifts open.]

Cassie: Let's bounce before the po-po come back. 

Scott: The po-po? How do you even know that? [Scott and Cassie get on a paper-mache ant.] Let's fly Antionette. Let's fly!

[Scott pushes a stick holding the ant in place, causing it to slide down the stairs. Scott and Cassie scream and whoop as the ant slides through a cardboard slide down the stairs, through the hallway, and eventually down the porch steps into the backyard.]

Scott: Crash landing! 

[Sure enough, the ant crashes into the fence. Scott and Cassie tumble into the ground in laughter. Cassie props herself up on her elbow.]

Cassie: I wish we could shrink for real.

Scott: Oh, that is pretty cool!

[Luis sticks his head out the top window, calling out to Scott.]

Luis: Hey, I'm headed to the office, Scotty. And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know. But I feel like I'm way better. My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff, and my hands are shaking, but I think that's unrelated, you know?

Scott: It's gonna be great, Luis. You got nothing to worry about. 

Luis: Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss... [Luis shrinks back into the house, almost trying to convince himself that it's going to be fine.]

[There's a shrill beeping.]

Cassie: [points] Daddy!

[The camera shows a black attachment outside the house beeping and blinking a red light. Scott looks at it in fear, then looks at his left foot, which is through the hole in the fence. Scott groans.]

[Cut to FBI agents looking through Scott's house. Agent Woo looks through the house, Scott and Cassie following him.] 

Scott: Come on, Woo! I got three days left. Why would I try to escape? 

Woo: I'm sorry, Scott, but rules are rules. You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place. Keel to stern. Soup to nuts. 

[A woman accidentally bumps the lampstand, sending a glass object to the ground. Scott looks as it shatters.]

Scott: ['sarcastically to the woman] Thank you. [to Woo] It was an accident. My foot went through the fence. 

Cassie: Our flying ant crashed.

[Woo looks at Scott in confusion and concern.]

Scott: Hey, you try entertaining a ten-year-old when you can't leave the house. You know the lengths that I've gone to? [Scott holds up his hand, and flicks it, making an Ace of Spades card appear in his hand out of thin air.] Close up magic. [He flicks the card away before putting his hand behind Cassie's ear and making another Ace of Spades return to his hand. He tosses it behind again.] I learned that. 

Cassie: Why can't you just leave my daddy alone?

[Woo looks to Scott in amusement before kneeling down to face Cassie at eye-level.]

Woo: Oh, Cassie. This must all seem like a bunch of confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh? Well, think of it this way: Your school has rules, right? Like...You can't draw on the walls. Well, your Daddy went to Germany and
drew on the walls with Captain America. And that was a violation of Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the Sokovia Accords.
[Woo is now rambling, seeming to forget a child is front of him.] Now as a part of his joint plea deal with Homeland Security and the German government, he's allowed to return to the U.S., provided he serve two years under house arrest, followed by three years of probation. and avoid any unauthorized activities, technology, or contact with any former associates, who were or currently are, in violation of said Accords, or any related statutes. [Woo looks satisfied with his answer. Cassie, however, has her eyes wide, trying to process all of the things he said.] Okay sweetie?

Scott: (sarcastically) Wow, you're really great with kids.

Woo: Thanks, I'm also a youth pastor. [Scott's face snaps from a smile to confusion.] Anyway, not to be a Johnny Ask-A-Lot, but you haven't had any contact with Hank Pym or Hope van Dyne, have you?

Scott: No. 

Woo: You sure? Because it's only a matter of time before we get 'em. It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too. And associating with them breaks your deal. And I don't need to remind you that any violation of your agreement means 20 years in prison. Minimum. 

Scott: I haven't talked to Hank or Hope in forever.

Cassie: They hate his guts.

Scott: Thanks, peanut. 

[Woo looks around before leaning towards Scott and lowering his voice.]

Woo: How'd you do it, Scott? 

Scott: Do what?

Woo: (slightly ashamed) The card trick.

Scott: (in slight disbelief) Seriously?

[Cut to Maggie, Scott's divorced wife, and Paxton, her current fiancee, walking up the steps to the house.]

Maggie: Oh my god! You people can't just show up here whenever you want and search the place.

Paxton: Actually they can.

Maggie: You need a warrant.

Paxton: Actually they don't.

Maggie: Really? Wow.

[Cut to Cassie leaving Scott's house, going to Maggie and Paxton's.]

Maggie: Did you pack your soccer shoes?

Cassie:  Yeah. [Cassie hugs her father]

Maggie: [walking up to Scott, embracing him and Cassie] Next time I see you, will be on the outside!

Paxton: Oh, get on the inside of this. [Paxton wraps his arms around the hug. Maggie laughs.] Three days! Seriously? I'm proud of you, buddy. [Paxton pulls away.]

Scott: Thank you.

Paxton: You know what? Give me another one. [Paxton hugs Scott again.] 

Maggie: Me, too! Freedom, business, I'm sensing greatness!

Cassie: I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

Scott: Me too, Peanut. Just wait till next weekend. Once I'm outta here, we're gonna go paint this town red. We'll have so much ice cream, we'll never stop puking. [He mimics retching, then puts his hand to his mouth and makes a barfing sound, a trail of cards extending from his mouth. Cassie giggles as the cards scatter everywhere.]

Maggie: You're getting good at that.

Paxton: How'd you do that?

Cassie: Bye, Daddy!

[An exchange of bye's are said as the three get in the car. Scott uses the stair railing to lean himself out the door, ankle brace staying in the house.] 

Scott: Three days... Easy-peasy.

[A montage starts of what Scott does to pass the time while the song "Come On Get Happy" by the Partridge Family plays.]

[Scott plays the toy drums.]

[Scott has toy pins set up. He throws a ball to hit them. The ball instead bounces over the pins. He pauses, frozen in the stance.]

[Scott watches a magic trick video on Online Close-Up Magic University.] 

Man in the Video: Snap your fingers. That gets them to look over there. Now that is misdirection. [Scott imitates the trick shown to him, shaking the deck and snapping his fingers. making the card change to a six of hearts. He  looks at the deck with satisfaction.]

[Scott has a karaoke screen on his TV, singing along to the song playing during the montage, "Come On Get Happy" by The Partridge Family.]

[Scott is crying while laying on his bed reading "The Fault In Our Stars" by John Green.]

[Scott perfects a yellow oragami swan he's hung from the ceiling.]

[Scott bounces a racquetball on the floor, which goes onto the wall, bounces onto the other wall, bounces on the floor and goes into a Nerf basketball hoop.]

[Scott works on a layout for his business.]

[Scott gets readyi to take a bath. He takes a plastic bag and uses a rubberband to seal up the bag so it doesn't get wet. He slides himself into the bath and sighs.]

Scott: Easy-peasy...

[He dozes off. Suddenly, he is back in the quantum realm. As he floats, Janet appears with him. Then, he is taken to a hallway in a home.]

Scott: [voiceover] What?

Janet: [voiceover] I'm gonna find you, Jellybean. [Young Hope can be heard giggling. A large, red wardrobe with horses on it comes into view. It is then opened by a hand extended into the camera's view. Hope is found inside.]  I found you!

Young Hope:  You always find me, Mommy.

Scott: [voiceover] What the hell?

[There's a mirror on the inside of the wardrobe. Scott looks to see that Janet is the reflection. He then snaps awake.]

[Scott breaks the wall in his room and grabs an old, outdated phone from it. He dials a number, and then puts the phone up to his ear.]


Scott: Hey, Hank. It's been a while. Umm... I don't even know if this is your number anymore... and, I'm probably the last person you wanna hear from. But... I just had a really weird dream. And I know that doesn't sound like an emergency or anything, but it just felt... very real. I was back in the Quantum Realm, and... I think I saw your wife. And then I was your wife. I mean, not in a weird way... You know... hearing this out loud, I'm thinking, it's not an emergency. I'm sorry to bother you. I'm sorry for a lot of things." [Scott pulls the phone away from his ear and hangs up. He then snaps the phone in two and throws it away to make sure they don't trace the call back.]

[Scott is sitting on the couch in his bathrobe, eating a bowl of cereal and watching TV. He takes a bite and swipes away a bug. The bug seemingly bites him, and he winces. He suddenly grows tired, and quickly passes out on the ground.]

[Scott's eyes flutter open to see that he's been put in the passengers seat of a car. He looks over and sees Hope behind the wheel

Scott: (drowsily) Hope? [She looks over at Scott before turning back to the road.] Is this another dream?


Hope: Do you think it's a dream, or is it possible that you really saw my Mom down there?

Scott: I'm not sure... [He suddenly remembers where he's supposed to be; at home. HIs eyes snap open.] I can't be here! I can't be, I'm under house arrest. [Scott tries to open the doors to the car.]


Hope: They won't open while the system's engaged, Scott. [Scott yells as his passenger window is greeted with a pigeon eye. The care has shrunk down. Another car drives over it, unaware of what lurks beneath.] 

Scott: You have to take me home. They can show up any second.

Hope: Relax. As far as your nanny cops know, you're still at home.

[Scott looks down at his ankle to see that his ankle cuff has been removed.]

[Cut back to Scott's house, where an enlarged ant is sitting on the couch with a box of Froot Loops and Scott's ankle cuff on. Luis stumbles in and yells at the sight of the ant.]


Luis: Woah! Scotty?

[Cut back to Hope's car.]

Hope: He's programmed to replicate your daily routine. Nine hours in bed, five hours in front of the TV, two hours in the bathroom -  whatever that's about.

Scott: (defensively)  That's totally inaccurate. And how do you know about my daily routine? Are you spying on me?

Hope: (with sharpness) We keep tabs on all security threats, all right? And so far, the biggest one we've had is you.

[The car drives through a steel pipe]

Scott:  I'm sorry about Germany. They just showed up. They said it was a matter of national security, that Cap needed help-

Hope: (as a scoff) Cap?

Scott: ...tain America. Captain... Cap. It's what we call him. (cocky and self-inflating)  If you're a friend. I think I'm a friend, a little. I know him. He's nice. Whatever... I'm sorry! All right? I didn't think I'd get caught.

Hope: You didn't think about a lot of things.

Scott:  How's Hank?

Hope: We're still running, the house is gone. So is our freedom. How do you think he is?

Scott:  I'm sorry. I know you're mad.


Hope: I'm not looking for an apology, Scott. The only reason why we're even talking is because we need what's in your head.

[Hope parks the car, making the car grow back to normal. Both get out of the car and walk into the building.They head towards the elevator. The lobby looks rough, as it's under construction. The two walk into an elevator, and Hope is silent throughout the whole walk.]


Scott: Is this where you're living? If you need help, money or something, maybe I can...

Hope: We're fine.

[The elevator doors ding open, and Hope walks out. Scott realizes that Hope and Hank are fine, as the place is filled with expensive tech and equipment. Scott follows Hope and he stops as he sees Hank. Hank catches his eye before reluctantly making his way over.]



Scott: Hey, Hank. Look... I just want to- 

Hank: Save it. Can we start?

Hope: Yeah. So, while you were relaxing at home, we were building this. It's a tunnel. To the Quantum Realm. To my Mom. We think she might still be down there, we just don't know where.

Scott: What?

Hope: If we can pinpoint my Mom's location, then the pod can take me down to get her.

Scott: You built all this and you don't even know if she's alive?

Hanks: It's called a hypothesis. Last night we powered up the tunnel for the first time. It overloaded, and it shut down. But for a split second, the doorway to the Quantum Realm was opened.

Scott:  And?

Hank: And five minutes later, you called. Talking about Mom. We think when you went down there, you may have entangled with her.

Scott: Hank, I would never do that. I respect you too much.

Hank:  Quantum entanglement, Scott.

Hope:  We think she might have put some kind of message in your head. Hopefully, a location. And opening the tunnel triggered it.

Scott:  Your Mom put a message in my head? Come on. That's insane.

Hank: No, Scott. Insane... is going to Germany without telling us and fighting the Avengers. Just tell me you weren't lying about the suit you took. Tell me you really destroyed it.

Scott: I did. I destroyed it. I swear.

Hank: I can't believe you destroyed my suit. That was my life's work.

Scott: What was I supposed to do?

Hank: You were supposed to not take my suit!

[Hank storms off down towards the lobby, Scott and Hope follow him]

Scott: I'm sorry, Hank. I'm sorry I took the suit. I'm sorry that I called last night. I don't remember seeing Janet down there. I wish that I did. I just had a dream about her playing hide and seek with a little girl. [Hank and Hope stop walking and Hank turns to face Scott]

Hope: What?

Scott: I had a dream. She was playing hide and seek with a little... girl. Cassie and I do it all the time. It doesn't mean anything.

Hope: But, was it Cassie in the dream?

Scott: No.

Hope: Where was she hiding?

Scott [confused]: What?

Hope: The little girl, where was she hiding. Was it in a wardrobe?

Scott: No, it's in a tall dresser.

Hank: You mean a wardrobe.

Scott: Is that what that's called?

Hope: What color was it?

Scott: Red.

[Hope and Hank exchange a look and Hank laughs under his breath]

Hope: Were there horses on it?

Scott: Oh, boy.

Hope:  It's where I hid every time we played.

Scott:  Doesn't sound like you really got the gist of the game.

Hope [to Hank]: She's alive!

Hank: I knew it. I knew it!

Hope: We need to get that part.

Hank: Okay. [

Hope and Hope walk excitedly back into the lab, followed by a confused Scott]

Hope: The sooner we get the tunnel working, the sooner we can get this message out his head.

Hank: Does Burch have it?

Hope: Yeah. Let's go.

Scott [confused]: What part? Who's Burch? Wait, what's happening? [Hope and Hank pick up a few pieces of equipment and walk out of the building towards the car, followed by Scott]

Hope: We need a component to stop the tunnel from overloading again. I brought your clothes. You might wanna change.

[Hope throws a full duffel bag towards Scott, which Scott catches. Hank presses a remote which shrinks the car. Hank then replaces the toy-sized car with a toy-sized ute before pressing the remote again the enlarge the ute]

Scott: Look. I'd really like to help you out. But if I'm not home when they come to take off my ankle monitor then I'm going away forever.

Hope:  Once we get the component and power up the tunnel, we'll get the message and have you home by lunch. We have to hurry. The entanglement won't last.

Hank: You owe us.

Scott: All right, fine. But can I just wait inside? Because I'm not supposed to be out here.

[Hank presses his remote again and the building shrinks down the the size of a suitcase and wheels it towards the ute, while Scott looks around confused]

Hank: Let's go.


We good? - Yeah. I'll be right back. - Can I have one of those? - No. Susan! - Welcome to Oui! - Sonny. Oui is French for yes. As in, yes, we found a table, yes, you saw us, and yes, to planning before property. Well, let's hope it also means yes to do you have the component I ordered? You know, I've always loved your sense of humor, Susan. - Have a seat. - No, I'm good. Thank you. - Who is this guy? - Sonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology. He's been getting us what we need to build the tunnel. - Can I just have one? - No. You know, I have a special friend, down at the FBI. And I say special, because... Well, he tells me things that I didn't previously know. For example... Your name isn't Susan. It's Hope Van Dyne. And your unseen associate, that's your father, Hank Pym. - That's not good, Hank. - No shit. What do you want? Relationships are built on trust, Hope. And I want our relationship to have a strong foundation. - Our relationship? - Well, business landscape's been shifting, Hope. Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra don't even exist, anymore. But now, Hank Pym? - Hank Pym, is a real opportunity. - Do you have a point? You think that I don't know what you've been building? With all of this? Quantum technology. And you can forget nano-tech. Forget AI. Forget cryptocurrency. Quantum energy is the future. It's the next gold rush. I want in, Hope. So, as a gesture of goodwill, I've taken the liberty of arranging some buyers for your lab. Starting bid? One billion dollars. Thank you, Sonny. Really. But my father and I have something slightly more pressing than starting a business. So, I'll just take the component. As arranged. My buyers don't take no for an answer. So, we're either in business together, or we aren't in business together. - Then, I guess we aren't. - You can go. But, I'm afraid your money's gonna have to remain. Let's call it compensation for my injured feelings. Listen, Sonny. This is gonna be so much easier on everybody if you just give me that component. No, the only thing you're taking from here, is my heart. But it will mend in time. Okay. - So now, what? - You'll see. She said her and daddy had something pressing. I wanna know what it is, 'cause if they're not working with us, they're working with somebody. So find out. Name... Hold on. You gave her wings? Not my 36-feet chandelier! Stop firing! Stop! Alright, take this. Go. Go, go, go, go! Wings and blasters. I take it you didn't have that tech available for me? No, I did. It's a pleasure doing business with you, Sonny. Oh, our business isn't finished yet, Hope. I can assure you of that. What the hell is that? [fights Ghost in her Wasp suit, though Ghost disappears; over the comm] Dad, are you seeing this? [watching Hope on the monitor with Scott] Hope, get out of there! - [reappears and flips Wasp onto a table] I gotta do something. [goes to leave] - Wait! [takes out a miniature Ant-Man suit for Scott] It's still a work in progress. You taught me that kick. Remember? - Yeah, great form. - Those were the days. - Whatever happened to us? - Not the time, Scott. Dammit, where did he go? I lost it. I'm not seeing anything on the ant cams. Dad? Give me that. Now. - Are you okay? - No. He got the lab. - No. - Come on. - What was that? - I don't know. But we need to find somewhere to regroup and figure out where the lab is. So where to now? How about my house? Mmm? I'm supposed to be there anyway. - Woo could walk in any second. - Exactly why we're not going to your house. What about your house? Sorry. There is one place I can think of. No. No, no! No! No! No! Wow, Dr. Pym. Like, who would've thought that, once again, in your hour of need, that you would turn to us? You know? Not me. Help yourself. That was overexpensive pastry. We gotta keep the food budget down. Well, what are we supposed to have for breakfast? - The oatmeal packets. - Oatmeal packets. - It's insult. - Why's it insult? - Because it takes like sand. - You know why? Cause it's organic. - That is not organic. It's sand. - The most important meal of the day. You know what, you can get creative with it. Put a little brown sugar on it. Sprinkle some cinnamon... Guys, guys, guys, guys! Come on, man! We got bigger fish to fry. - Is that my desk? - Yeah. What? Why do I have such a small desk? - Cause you weren't there when we're choosing desks. - You snooze, you lose. - I was under house arrest. - Yeah! You know what, this isn't even a desk. This is garbage. You found this outside amongst garbage. I got it out of rummage sale. - So, you saved money on my desk? - Guys. Hope, please! We need to focus. All right? We gotta find that lab already. Geez. Oh, you know what? I heard stories, like what happened to you. Like this crazy, creepy cat who like, walks through walls and stuff. Like a... Like a Ghost! Like Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga. A witch. They tell stories to children to frighten them. You know Baba Yaga? Whoever stole it... We need to find it. Well, you don't find someone like that. - They find you. - Like Baba Yaga. Dr. Pym, you're like the smartest genius I know. Did you put some kind of lojack on your lab? Because if you didn't, we have a variety of affordable options. Of course, I did, Luis. It was disabled. Whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing. - They also looked like they were phasing. - Phasing? Quantum phasing. When an object moves through different states of matter. Oh, yeah. That's what I was thinking. The lab emits radiation. Could we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it? That could work, yes. But all of my equipment is in the lab. Well, where else can we find that equipment? Well, there is one person. - Bill Foster. - Great! Who's Bill Foster? He's an old colleague of my Dad's. From SHIELD. - They had a falling out years ago. - You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people. It's probably just a waste of time. Hey, I'm risking everything by being here. Don't you think we should check? We need to find out who took the lab. Guys, it's not a good idea to be out in the open like this. Relax. No one's gonna recognize us. What, because of hats and sunglasses? It's not a disguise, Hank. We look like ourselves in a baseball game. In an isolated system... Particles co-exist in a stable phase relationship. If the system is interfered with, that stability becomes chaos. Unpredictable. Dangerous. Beautiful. Isolated completely, a quantum system would revert back to separate states of matter. Each entangled with a distinct state of its environment. In other words... The object in question would be both in and out of phase with multiple parallel realities. Speaking of being out of phase with reality... I am noticing an unusally high number of glazed eyes out there among you. So, why don't we call it a few minutes early. That will be enough for today, thank you, ladies and gentlemen. You may go. It's incredible. Your link to Janet. It's Quantum entanglement, between the quantum states composed of her molecules and your brains. Yeah. It's what I was thinking. Do you guys just put the word 'quantum' in front of everything? Doctor, we need to find our lab. Hope, I'd love to help you but I don't have the equipment you're describing. I told you this was a waste of time. Come on. Let's go. Don't condescend, Hank. You're the one who's on the run from the FBI. All because you had to grow to a size that finally fit your ego. That wasn't me in Germany. It was this idiot. Really? Going that big must've been exhausting. I slept for three days straight. You have no idea. Actually, I do. Back in the day, I was Hank's partner in a project called Goliath. Excuse me, you were my partner? The only thing more tiring than going that big, is putting up with Hank's bullshit. How big did you get? My record? Twenty-one feet. - Not bad. - You? - I don't... - No, really. I'm curious. - Sixty-five feet. Yeah. - Whoa. - Huge. - Sixty-five. If you two are finished comparing sizes... We need to figure out a way to track down the lab. And the great Hank Pym hasn't figured that one out yet? Strange. He had all the answers back in the day. That's why I left the project. Left? I fired you. Best decision I ever made. Hank was a terrible partner. Temperamental. Stubborn. Impatient. Sooner or later he just pushed everyone away. Just the mediocrities. Janet was the only one who could endure him and chose to stick it out. Watch it, Bill. She paid the price though, didn't she? You son of a... We didn't come here to listen to you two squabble. I'm trying to save my Mother. It's Woo. Someone must have seen me. Relax. If this is about you they'd be in your house by now. - What are you, fifteen? - Come on. We gotta go, right now. Wait! You might be able to improvise that tracker. If you modify the defraction units on one of your regulators. - That could work. - I don't know what that means. Thank you. But Doctor, campus police says they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne. I don't know what to tell you, agent. I haven't talked to Hank in thirty years. I can assure you I'm the last person he would wanna visit. - Oh, come on. You expect us to... - Hey, hey. - Why is that? - Simple. We hate each other's guts. So I'm a terrible partner? Foster, he hasn't had one good idea in his unremarkable career. But his idea about the defractors could work. Fine, one decent idea. Except I eliminated the defractors when I upgraded the suits. So if we had an old suit, we might be able to track down the lab? Yes. But we don't. - What if we did? - What do you mean? I mean... - Life's funny... - Oh, my God. - You didn't destroy the suit. - What?! Well, it was your life's work, Hank. I couldn't destroy that. Before I turned myself in, I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis. You sent my suit through the mail? Hey, the postal service is very reliable, you know? They do tracking numbers now. Like UPS. Where is it? It's in a very safe place, alright? Don't worry. What, the trophy? No, it's not here. What do you mean it's not there? Where could it be? I've looked everywhere. It's not here. Hey. Get away from the table. I put it back out to Cassie, and I... Show and tell. Scotty? Well, the good news is, I know where it is. Whenever you go back to school, isn't everything supposed to look so much smaller? This place seems huge. Ah! - What is it? - It's the new regulator. Hank, what's going on with this suit? How much of a work in progress is this? Uh-oh. Oh, no. No, no, no. What, are you laughing? Please, can you just... Okay. Okay. What do you see? The sizing coils are malfunctioning. Just let me... Oww! - Sorry. - It's all right. Okay. All right. Try it now. So... Awesome. If only Cap could see you now. Hilarious. What are we gonna do? Hey! Where's your hall pass? Hey, I'm talking to you. Hey! Hey... You can do it. You almost got it! Oh, Peanut. Okay. Let's go. Hiya, Champ! How was school today? Hahaha. Alright, get your jokes out now. - Can you fix the suit? - He's so cranky. You want a juice box and some string cheese? Do you really have that? Let's see if Foster was right. This has got to be the lab. - Let's go get it. - Yeah. This seems right. Look at us. Teaming up twice in one day. Makes you think, huh? - About what? - Germany? - What do you mean? - We were working together. Training together. And, other stuff-ing together. If I'd have asked you, would you have come? I guess we'll never know. But I do know one thing. What? If I had, you'd have never been caught. Hey, Scott. You think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter long enough to get my lab? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Okay. You're transmitting. What took you so long? Sorry, I had to come up with a name for my ant. I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant. - Like it? - Hilarious. I'm not getting anything on the monitors. There's some kind of electronic disturbance. - Be careful. - You know me, Hank. I'm always care--- Whoa! - It's okay. It's just a suit. - How do you know? Look. That's Ghost? What is she doing? You think that suit is how she goes through walls and stuff? Let's just get out of here before she wakes up. Hope, look. There's the lab. We're sure this is our shrunken building and not somebody else's, right? Just take it, Scott. We gotta be fast. I'll get it. Oh, sh... Hope. Hank. Guys? I don't think they can hear you. Hi. I'm Ava. Scott. So... You don't need a suit to, uhh... You know. Go through things. No. It just helps me control it. And the pain. Supposedly. You're not gonna reach into my chest and crush my heart, are you? You're funny. I'm not gonna hurt you Scott, unless I have to. I need... What's in your head. Let's wake up the rest of the gang and get this over with, shall we? Get up! Come on! Dad? Don't ever touch him again. Now, now, Hope... I think I'm being rather gentle with your Father, all things considered. What the hell are you talking about? Another casualty of Hank Pym's ego. Bill. What have you done? It's what you've done, Dr. Pym. You with her? Aw, man. I thought you were cool. What the hell is going on here? I doubt Hank have ever mentioned my Father. Why would he? Elihas Starr. They were colleagues at SHIELD. Quantum research. Until my Father dared to disagree with the great Hank Pym. You had him fired. Oh, and discredited for good measure. My father tried to continue his research on his own. Desperate to restore his name, so he took risks. No! Too many. Until something went wrong. He told us to run. - Elihas, what's happening? - Just go. Go! Daddy! I can tell he was scared. - Daddy! - Ava, no! I didn't want him to be alone. No! No! When I woke up, my parents were dead. I wasn't so lucky. They call it "Molecular Disequilibrium." A rather dull name, I think. Doesn't quite do justice to what it means. Every cell, in my body, is torn apart and stitched back together. Over, and over, everyday. I was still at SHIELD when I got the call about a "quantum anomaly" in Argentina. Hello, Ava. My name is Bill. I was a friend of your Father's. I brought you something. It's all right. Try again. That's it. Dr. Foster did his best to keep me safe. But others at SHIELD saw an opportunity in my affliction. They built me a containment suit so I can control my phasing. And trained me to be a stealth operative. They weaponized me. I stole for them, spied for them... I killed for them. And in exchange for my soul, they were going to cure me. They lied. When SHIELD collapsed, I took Ava in. I built the chamber to slow her decay, but her condition was progressive. I didn't know how to cure her. She wanted to kill you, Hank. But I told her, no. And that she should watch you instead. And sure enough, she discovered that you were building a tunnel. Then she told me about Lang. And the message from Janet inside his head... - For Christ's sake! - That's me. I'm sorry. Look, can you tell me who's texting me? Cassie. 911. That's my daughter. I need to text her back. No. That's not happening. It's 911. That means it's an emergency! You're not making demands here, Lang. You're not appreciating the gravity of the... Okay, well, she's trying to videochat me now. Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please! Cassie, are you okay? What's the emergency? - I can't find my soccer shoes. - What? I have a game tomorrow. Hey, Scott, I know that they're there. Can you just walk the phone around the house? - No, I can't do that right now. - Why not? Because I'm sick. Hey, can you just maybe look around later then call me back? Please? Thank you. - Bye, Daddy! - Bye, Peanut! - Feel better! - Feel better, buddy! I'm sorry. It's that emergency. Ava, I wanna help you. She doesn't need your help. I know how to save her. - Oh, really? How? - Janet. For the last 30 years, she's been down there absorbing quantum energy. We can extract that energy. We can use it to repair Ava's molecular structure... - Extract it? - Yes! Are you insane? That would rip Janet apart! You don't know that. I'm gonna fire up your tunnel. When Janet's location pops into Lang's head, he's gonna give it to me, - or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI. - What? You're gonna stay here just in case I need your help. - Like hell, I would help you! - You'll do whatever I say. - You're gonna kill Janet. - I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank. Goddammit, Bill! - Dad? - Calm down, Hank. So help me, God... It's his heart! He needs his pills, please. Dr. Foster, they're in the tin, please. He could die! For... come on! Help him! Dad, just hang on, alright? Just keep breathing. Stay calm. - Help him, man! Come on! - The Altoid tin! Wait! Thanks, guys! Hank! Bill is filling that girl's head with lies. Elihas Starr was a traitor. He stole my plans. Now, bring her down. Right, lock it in. No, no, no. The bolt is on the other side. Tighten that one down, then bring her down with one knock. - Good job. - It'll work. Foster, he could've fried the entire system. Look, we'll adjust the relays while you go reprogram the settings. All right? It's gonna be fine. - So, this is it. - Yeah. You'd think with all this time to prepare, I'd be more ready. Well, going subatomic isn't something you can prepare for. It kind of, melts your mind. - I mean, seeing my Mom again. - Oh. What if she's a completely different person? Yeah, like George Washington? - I'm serious, Scott. - Or, George Jefferson? What if she's forgotten about me? When I was in prison... The only thing that got me through was Cassie. I could've been locked up for 100 years. I never would've forgotten her. I know your Mom is counting the minutes until she can see you again. Thank you. - Hey. - We've got a big problem. You forgot the motion sensor lights on the back of the building. No. They're on the proposal, and Karapetyan asked for them specifically. Uh, yeah. Look, it's been a little crazy... Look, maybe I can stop by tomorrow and take a look at it. No, no, no, no! The meeting is first thing in the morning. You gotta come right now and fix it. I can't. I wish I could, but I can't leave. You know what, I'm coming to you. I'll just explain the plans, and get it on the laptop, and you can fix them in. - Just tell me where you are, okay? - It's complicated. What do you mean, it's complicated? As you can see, sir... This system is state-of-the-art. Security of tomorrow... today! Oh, that's so good! I love the lead-in, Bro. Keep practicing. Hey, I just gotta drive on to Scotty's, so he can fix the plans. But don't worry. I'll be back in plenty of time. As you can see, sir... Oh! Oh! Oh! Tell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning. Down to the undercarriage, baby. - You sprung for the undercarriage wash? - Well, you said get the works. That's a scam, Bro. We live in California, not Minnesota! He's right. The undercarriage wash. That's for cleaning off road salt. Laid out in all those snow-laden sister states. Who are you and why do you know so much about car wash protocol? Well, my name is Sonny Burch. And I do my research, Luis. To wit, I have learned, from a friend of mine, at the FBI, that you're a known associate of Scott Lang. A known associate of Hank Pym. Who I've also learned, has a portable frickin' laboratory. Filled with all kinds of juicy tech. And you're gonna tell me where it is. Well, I hate to break it to you, but I don't know what you're talking about. Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis. And I have promised results to some dangerous people. So, I'm gonna introduce you, to my good friend Uzman. Now, Uzman, is a master at extracting information from the unwillin' through psychoactive means. Oh, is that truth serum? There's no such thing as truth serum. That's just nonsense from TV. - What is it, then? - It's a little concoction, that he's been perfecting since his days with the SIS. It makes you suggestible. And highly responsive. - Dude, that's truth serum! - No, it's not. No fencing, but, - this sound like truth serum to me. - Right?! - It's not a truth serum. - Oh, okay. Hey, I believe you. It's not a truth serum. If it walk like duck, and talk like ducks... It's truth serum. Well, I have a lot of allergies. So... You might wanna think about that. Time to get that lab back. What? The chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore. How long have I got? A couple of weeks, maybe. Well then, we'll make them bring the lab back. How? Lang. He has a daughter, right? You can't mean that. Ava? I tolerate a lot of the things you do out there, but I won't be a part of anything like that. You're not the one who's about to fade away into nothing, Bill. I am! You said you could fix me. You promised! I know. I will. But not like that. You let one finger on that little girl... I won't help you. And we're done. Fine. There are other options. You know what? You're right. This isn't truth serum. 'Cause I don't feel anything. That was a lie. I did feel something. - This is truth serum! - There's no such thing. Okay! Okay, okay. Now I'm gonna make this real easy for you, Luis. Okay. Where... is Scott Lang? Well, see, that's complicated. 'Cause when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place. And I'm not talking about cell block D. His wife had just filed for divorce. And I was like, "Damn, homie, she dumped you while you were in lock-up?" And he's like, "Yeah, I know. I thought I was gonna be with her forever, but now, I'm all alone!" And I was like, "Damn, homie, you gotta chin up. 'Cause you'll find a new partner. But you know what? I'm Luis." And he says, "You know what? I'm Scotty. And we're gonna be best friends." Wait, hold on, hold on. Now I like a good story as much as the next person, but what's this have to do with where Scott Lang is? I'm getting there, I'm getting there. You put a dime in him, you got to let the whole song play out. He hit like human jukebox. Oh! My abuelita had a jukebox in a restaurant. Yeah. Only played Morrissey. And if anybody ever complained, she'd be like, "Oh, porque? Gusta mas?" And El Chicanos, we call them mas, "then, adios!" What can I say? We relate to these melancholy bandits, you know? - Lang. - Right, right, right, right. So anyway, this guy gets out of jail and starts working for Hank. And that's when he met Hope. And Hope's all like, "I want nothing to do with you. Look at my hairdo. I'm all business." And then Scotty's like, "You know what, girl? My heart's all broken, and I'll probably never find love again. But damn, if I want to kiss you!" But then you fast-forward and they're all like into each other, right? And then Scotty's like, "You know what, I can't tell you this, but I'm gonna go trashing the airport with Captain America!" Then she said, "I can't believe you split like that! Smell you later, dummy!" So Scotty goes on house arrest, and he won't admit it, but his heart's all like, "Damn! I thought Hope could've been my new true partner. But I blew it!" But fate brought them back together, and then Hope's heart is all, "I'm worried that I can't trust him. And he's gonna screw up again and ruin everything." And in my heart, it's all like, "That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's rent. And we're days away from going out of business! Oooh!" - Out of business? - Days away?! Damn truth serum! I was trying to protect you guys. I swear to God. I was trying to be a good boss. But we're broke. And the Karapetyans are our last hope, and if we don't show up, we're done! - That's terrible bossing. - Damn, Bro! - That's on me. That's on me! - Hey! Enough. I'm gonna ask you one more time... Where is Scott Lang? I've been trying to tell you. He's in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking. Emotionally speaking. But where is Scott Lang, literally speaking?! Oh! The woods. The woods? Baba Yaga! What do you mean, the woods? The Muir woods! For God's sake! Baba Yaga, coming late, little children, sleep at eight. Damn it! If that freak gets Pym's tech, I'm never gonna see it. So what do we do now? It's easier to steal it from the feds than from a boogeyman. Hey. It's me. How'd you like to get a promotion? I've got the location on Pym, Van Dyne, and Lang. But you're gonna have to take them down now, 'cause they ain't gonna be there for long. And when you do, you're gonna get me that lab. Understood. Good news, gentlemen. Feds are gonna do the hard work for us. What are you looking at? Change my tire! Sir... Can you knock? Sorry, sir. But I just got a lead. Ooh. I love leads. - Systems in the green. - Priming the coils. Full charge. Soon as the tunnel's open, let us know if you get anything that could be part of her message. Yeah, yeah. I will. Okay, then. Here it goes. We did it! You got anything? Nothing. Just give it a minute. Because it could... No. No, no, no! - What's happening? - It's shutting down. Maybe vectors are off. We've gone over them a million times. I know they're right. - Well then, what else could it be? - I don't know. - Scott, what are you doing? - Scott, get away from that! Scott, we had... I'm sorry. I don't know how much time I have. I need to fix the algorithm. Trust me, after 30 years down here... I've thought about it a lot. Janet? Hi, Hon. Hello, Jellybean. Mom? It's not the reunion I had imagined. It's all so rushed. You two have done such great work. You just need a little... nudge. Janet, how is this possible? It wasn't a message you put in Scott's head. It was an antenna. Clever girl. I'm so proud of you. Honey, tell us where you are. Tell us how to find you. No, the probability fields are too complex. That's why I needed to talk to you. You have to follow my voice. - Of course. - Like tracing a call back to its source. I'm tracking your signal using subatomic frequencies, between point 2 and point 9. - I've narrowed it to 4 and 6. - It's too tight. We could miss you. Look at us squabbling again. Fine. Between 3 and 7. Our first fight in decades and it's over just like that. Bull's eye. - Source lock. - It's you! Ha! We got it! You have to meet me in these exact coordinates. In the wasteland, beyond the quantum void. It's very dangerous, especially on the human mind. So be careful. Time and space work very differently down here. You have two hours. After that, the probability fields will shift, and it'll be another century before they'll align like this again. We'll find you. I know you will, Jellybean. Nope. Nothing. I got nothing. No sign of Janet. How did we get up here? At first, you'll see all kinds of lights, and it's gonna get really trippy but then it's gonna turn black and silent. Like, really silent. Scott, I'll be fine. - I'm just saying. Cause I've been down there. - Yeah, so you've mentioned. Um, sorry. I have to take this. Hey, man. You coming? No, I'm not. But you know what? Ghost is. And you know what? The feds, they know where you are. - What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. They gave me some truth serum, then all of a sudden I started talking all honestly, like, I hate the way that you use the dishwasher. I hate it. But you need to go home because the feds are probably going there now! And by the way, who puts the plates on the top rack, okay? They don't go there! I feel like such a jerk. You're gonna be really mad. We gotta go. - What? - Ghost knows where we are. - So does the FBI. - How? - I told Luis where we are. - You what? I told him to come here, so I can help him with the Karapetyan proposal. Oh, my God! But... Look, we need to land that account. Otherwise, we'll lose the business! Do you know how hard it is for ex- cons to find work these days? Jesus, Scott! 90 seconds to close the aperture. - You have to depolarize the coils first. - I know. I'm really sorry, but the... FBI is coming to my place, so... I have to go. Can I borrow the suit? Look, uhh... I'm just gonna borrow the suit. I'll come back. Just tell me where you'll be. - Don't bother. - What? We'll come and get the suit from you as soon as we find my Mom. - Hope... - Scott, just go! - Scott? - Daddy? - It's us, buddy! - We're here for Cassie's shoes. He must be resting. Honey, why don't you go up the stairs and go look under your bed. Daddy? You upstairs? Daddy... What the? Really lives like a pig these days. Daddy? Spread out! - Again? - You people have no shame! - The monitor says that he's in the bathroom. - Yeah. I'm not buying it. Cassie, let the man get by. - But Daddy's super sick! - I'll see about that. He says he doesn't want anyone else to get sick. Well, I'll take my chances, sweetie. He barfed. Like, a lot. Young lady, I'm a federal agent. I've seen worse things than vomit. - Like, a lot, a lot? - Yes! - Forget it. Move aside. - No! Woo! - What are you doing here? - Scott. I'm sorry. I'm just really sick. I told you. Excuse me. Sometimes you just gotta get it out, you know? Sorry. I'll start the van. You get the lab. Freeze! You're surrounded! Hank Pym. Hope Van Dyne. You're under arrest. - This is harassment. - Actually, it's not. What does the FBI even stand for? Forever Bothering Individuals? - His monitor check out? - Of course, it does. Damn it. It's like I just got fed a bowl of malarkey. We got them, sir. Pym and Van Dyne are in custody. Seriously? Yes! Oh. Sorry, Scott. They were your friends. That's insensitive. I just really needed a win, you know? Anyway... I'll be back later for the official end of your sentence. Sorry for misjudging you, pal. You should feel great about yourself. What is it? We have a man down, and Pym's lab is gone. Hey. - Thanks for covering for me. - Sure. So.. How long have you been Ant-Man again? Not long. Things just sort of happened. I'm sorry, for lying to you. I'm sorry for risking everything. - Dad, it's okay. - That's not... I do some dumb things, and the people that I love the most pay the price. Mainly, you. Trying to help people isn't dumb. Well... I screw it up just about every time. So maybe, you just need someone watching your back. Like a partner. Well, she's made it clear that's about the last thing she wants. - Who? - Hope. - What, who did you think? - Me. You? Don't laugh. - I'd be a great partner. - Oh, Peanut! You would be awesome. And if I let you, I would be a terrible Dad. Fine. Have Hope be your partner. She's smart. She reminds me of you. You gonna go help her? I think you should help her. I wish I could, but... I don't know how I can help her without hurting you. You can do it. You can do anything. You're the World's Greatest Grandma. Agent Woo will see you in an hour. An hour? We don't have an hour. Aww. You got somewhere else to be? Now, that's my girl. Alright, what's our plan? To shrink that wall. It looks load bearing. Ceiling could collapse... - Then we run like hell. - It's made up of 15-20 agents on the floor. Roughly five times that in the building at large. - They're all heavily armed. - Not great odds. - You got any better ideas? - Nope. But I'm not giving up on Mom. She'd be so proud of you. Okay. One... Two... Scott? What are you two just standing around for? We gotta go find that lab. What about me? Perfect. Hurry up and get dressed. We don't have much time. Sir. Okay. Now what? You're asking me? Get in! Hi. Hi. Uhh, excuse me. Are we planning on leaving soon, or are you two gonna keep staring at each other until they start shooting at us. - Hey, Burch. - Yeah? - Yeah. They're out. - I'm on my way. - As soon as we see him, so was the van. - How could this happen? What the dickens? Thank you. You're welcome. So, uhh... How do we find the lab? After I lost it the first time, I put on a new tracker... ...of sorts. That'll work. Is it ready or not? We can begin the extraction process now. Listen, Ava, this whole thing could be very dangerous. - Maybe, maybe we should... - Maybe we should what? Wait? I've got days until I'm dead. We're doing this, Bill. Now. Energy readings show they have not used the tunnel yet. We don't have much time before Mom's location shifts and we lose her. Yeah, and we have a lot to do before that. You know, my Pap-pap always said if you wanna do something right, you make a list. So, we should do that. One, we have to break into that lab. Two, we have to kick out Foster and Ghost. Three, we have to fight Ghost. That seems like it should be part of 2. 2-A. Right? Let's call it 2-A. Fight Ghost, 2-A. Oh! Also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully grown for you to come back. Otherwise we're screwed... Scott... You want me to start again? I'll start again. I'm going to dive. The only chance we've got is if the 2 of you are out here together, protecting the tunnel. Let me do this, Hope. Please. Let me get her. I think he's right. Whassup? You remember that beloved commercial? Whassup? I had him follow us here. I thought we could use some help. All right. I'm in position. The ants are headed in. - Copy that. - Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty. - You want a pez? - No. Guess who gave me this for my birthday. By the way, I love that suit! Thanks, man. I wish I had a suit. I would even like a suit with like minimal powers, you know? Or maybe, even just a suit. With no powers. What is it? I don't know. It's them. They can't be far. Hank? Hank? Stop it! Dad, what's your status? Foster's taken care of. Suiting up, now. I just wanted to save Ava. She's facing death or something far more terrible. She's afraid. I'll help you find a cure when I get back. I promise. Together, we'll figure something out. Good luck, Hank. Thanks, Bill. Now, I'm gonna need you to step back. Time remaining: fifteen minutes. Hank's in, Scott. Any sign of her? No. Nothing yet. Ava! Call off the ants, Scott. Oh, boy. Can I get a status report, cause I got some serious Ghost problems here! Ready to dive. - In case I don't make it... - Don't. Don't say that. I can't lose you, too. I love you, Hope. Guys, everything's bad over here. Please... Now. Misdirection. One of the first things they teach you at Online Close-up Magic University. No! All right. We got it, Scotty. - Meet us at the rendezvous point. - Okay. On my way. Oh, no. Really? - This guy? Again? - Who? I told you our business wasn't over. Change of plans. Hang on. I want that lab, boys. Whatever it takes. Hold on. Oh! That undercarriage is filthy! Now they have bigger problems. Hope, what are you doing? You're heading away from the rendezvous point. Don't worry. I'm taking these guys on the scenic route. Wait, what are you... Oh. No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, we're gonna die! We're gonna die! Signal lost. What the hell are they doing up there? Recalibrating. Recalibrating. You never said it was so beautiful, Scott. Recalibrating. Okay. Anytime now. Recalibrating. - Recalibrating. - Come on. Signal restored. Bikes, it's all on you. - Take the wheel. - What? Wait, Hope! Well, the 60's were fun. But now, I'm paying for it! Be careful up there! Give me a break. I haven't driven in two years. You got pez'd! Up here! Oh, that's not good. Hope! No! There it is right there, the lab. Get it, get, get, get the lab! I've got her. Westbound on Primo. Hope! Wait! Hey! What about me? We got you now, Ava! Not again! Piece of junk! Yes! Go. Go! Go, go, go, go! Burch got the lab. I'm going after him. No, no, no, no, no! Work in progress, my ass. Scott, where are you? I've got Burch in my sights. Hurry! - I'm coming, I'm coming! - We're running out of time! Warning. Approaching quantum void. I'm coming to you, Honey. Guys... Don't you need the remote to the lab? I just found it. We can't grow the lab without it. Get it to us, fast. - Yeah, but the van is busted. - Use the Hot Wheels Rally case. Wha? I love you, Dr. Pym. The remote! We're missing the remote. We gotta check the van. Huh? Awesome! Hey, I'm going left. But Burch's boys are all over me. - I'm on my way. - Right. I'll get the lab. Hi! Oh, that's badass! Nice! Toink! Come here, you little weasel! Oh, no, you don't! I guess... Well, maybe, you do. Come on! Anyone see a southern gentleman carrying a building? How did he even have time to buy a ticket? Just one time, please. Work! Yes! All right, I need help. That's it. Oh... sorry! Hey! Come on, man! Not cool! Murderers! Yes! Yes! I'm gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas. 'Cause you're a badass! Yes! No. No. No! Ant-onio! Our friends the humpbacks dip in here to the San Francisco bay for a little leisure, - and a little breeding. - Listen, Uzman... Just meet me at the waterfront in three hours. Oh, folks, we barely left the dock, but it looks like we have some company! You see it, folks? There it is. There's a breach. What the... Hi. Sorry. Hi. It's okay, it's okay. Sorry. No, I'm not a whale. This will just take a second. Hey! That doesn't belong to you. - No! No! No! No! - You're embarassing yourself now. - Come on. Let go! - No! Thank you. I'll take this now. No... ... melts your mind... ... a message in your head... ... I had a dream... Daddy? Dad? What's going on? Why haven't you found Mom? You look lost, Hank. Are you all right? Still think you have all the answers, Hank? It's me. I'm so sorry! - It took so long. - No. I do know... You're here now. Let's go home. I thought I was gone. But that energy from your hands... How did you do that? I'm not the same woman I was 30 years ago, Henry. This place... It changes you. And adaptation is part of it, but some of it is... Evolution. Lab coordinates not found. Do not ascend. I should probably tell you what we're dealing with up there. I got the lab. I got the lab. Move. Move... Move! Get out of the... Let's go. No one here appears to be sure what this is. It seems he's 90, 80, 85 feet tall. Get out of the way! I got the lab. The lab! Okay... The earth feels junky. Oh, no. He's too big. - Scotty! - Scott! I'm gonna go to sleep. I'm just gonna go to sleep now for five minutes. I just need five minutes. Five minutes... You get the lab somewhere safe. Scott's air won't last! Okay! Move. Move. Move! No, wait! Lab at full scale. - They did it! - Ready to ascend. Let's go see our daughter. Scott. Scott! Scott, come on. Wake up. Come on. Come on. Where are you, Scott? Gotcha. Scott? Hey! Hey, Scotty. Hope, come in. Do you take any questions 'bout the building? - Sco... - Where's the remote, Luis? It's probably in there. I don't have it. I don't have it. I guess this is where we say, Adios, amigo. No, no, no! Thanks, guys. Ava? Ava! Ava. - Almost ready for extraction. - Please, stop. People are getting hurt. Everything hurts. Don't talk to me about pain. What if Hank was right? What if this process kills Janet? You're worried about her? All I'm saying is she's a brilliant scientist. She may be able to help. Oh, she will help. Right now. And if she dies, she dies! I'm sorry, we can't do this. We have to find another way. This is the way. Janet! She's starting the extraction. She's gonna tear Mom apart. No! Hope! Are you okay? Mom? Oh, my God. We found you. I missed you so much. I missed you too, Jellybean. It's okay. I'm, I'm here now. We have time. No more last minute business trips, okay? I promise. It's okay, it's fine. Don't worry about me. - I'll be fine. - Dad! Scott. Miss Van Dyne. It's nice to... I guess we've already met. I guess we have. Wait. Your pain... I can feel it. It hurts. It always hurts. I'm sorry. I think I can help you. Do you know she could do that? It's okay. Guys, the cops are coming. Whoa! The, uhh, the... The cops are coming. Like all of them. - I gotta go. - We gotta go. What about them? Hands in the air! No. No, no, we do our jobs. You see, we see these guys, they trying to shoot people. So we apprehended them. For you. You're welcome. - We traffic in stolen technology. - And they have killed many, many people. - He's in charge. - That's true. I am. I've also committed numerous healthcode violations in my restaurant. Some of them would shock you. It is truth serum. We gotta get out of here. Fast. I have an idea. Giant figure now spotted at the intersection of Broadway and Wycona. - All units move in. - Go. Go. There he is. It's over, Scotty. I'm sorry but we got you, man. Come on, it's the end of the line, pal. There's nowhere to hide. Just pull off that band-aid. You lost. it's okay. Dammit, Scotty! Reduce yourself! Magic? Dammit. Get to Lang's. Now. Well done, Honey. Let's go! - Leave me here. - We can make it. You said it yourself. I've hurt people. But you haven't. - Go, please. - We can make it, Ava. Bill... I'm not leaving you. Oh, hey guys. Are my two years up already? What's it like out there? I mean... Do people still dance? Are food trucks still a thing? You got away with it this time, Scott, but... I'll be seeing you again. Where? Huh? Where will you be seeing me again? Like... in general, I'll see you. Like, the next time you do something bad. - I'll be there. To catch you. - Ohh. You'll be watching me. I thought you were inviting me somewhere. Why would I do that? That's what I was wondering. Why would you do that either? Like a party, or dinner or something? I don't know. I thought you were planning the evening. No. I meant to, like, arrest you. Like, I'll arrest you later again. - Take it easy. - Okay. Did you wanna go out tonight or something? [Scott shakes his head no] I mean, 'cause I'm free. Yeah. Come on. - You ready? - Yes! - Daddy! - Hi! Yes, that was a... - 8:30, Monday. - Sounds great. Mr. Karapetyan? Yeah, you saw that? Well, it would be an honor to be in business with you as well. I'll see you Thursday, 9 A.M. Okay. This is awesome. So, Cassie... What do you wanna be when you grow up? I wanna help people. Like my Dad. Really? I wanted to be his partner. But he said he wants you. Is that so? Daddy! Hold on. - Move! Get outta here! - No. Don't. Don't! Oh! Gross. Ugh. I hate that moth dust. Go. Shoo! Shoo! Don't get sucked into a time vortex. We won't be able to save you. "Okay. Healing particles secured for our new ghost friend." "Great. Preparing for reentry in five... four... three-" "Hello? Ha ha, very funny. Hank, quit screwing around. [cut to Dr. Hank Pym, Hope van Dyne and Janet has all been disintegrated] You told me yourself not to screw around. Hank! Hope? Janet! Guys. Guys! Okay, seriously, don't joke around, bring me up, let's go! GUYS?!"
